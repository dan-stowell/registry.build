Breaking Changes\r\nThis version of protovalidate removes various deprecated fields and enumeration values:\r\n- `skipped` on `FieldConstraints`: Set `ignore = IGNORE_ALWAYS` instead.\r\n- `ignore_empty` on `FieldConstraints`: Set `ignore = IGNORE_IF_UNPOPULATED` instead.\r\n- `field_path` on `Violation`: Use the structured `field` value instead.\r\n- `IGNORE_EMPTY` on `Ignore`: Use the `IGNORE_IF_UNPOPULATED` enumeration value instead.\r\n- `IGNORE_DEFAULT` on `Ignore`: Use the `IGNORE_IF_DEFAULT_VALUE` enumeration value instead.\r\n\r\nThese options had been deprecated for a while,

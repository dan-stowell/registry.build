Breaking changes\r\n\r\nThis version of protovalidate includes breaking changes to the [conformance test harness](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate/tree/v0.10.2/tools/protovalidate-conformance). These changes will not affect you, unless you are authoring a protovalidate implementation and use the test harness.\r\n\r\nTest cases for `isEmail`, `isHostname`, `isHostAndPort`, `isIpPrefix`, `isIp`, `isUri`, and `isUriRef` have been added to the harness. `isEmail` follows the HTML standard now instead of RFC 5322. See #320 for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## `MODULE.bazel` Usage\r\n```bzl\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"protovalidate\", version = \"0.10.2\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `WORKSPACE`

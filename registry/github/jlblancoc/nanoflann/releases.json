1.5.0: Released Jun 16, 2023\r\n * **API changes:**\r\n   - Users of radius search should change their result placeholder type:\r\n   `std::vector<std::pair<IndexType, DistanceType>>` => `std::vector<nanoflann::ResultItem<IndexType, DistanceType>>`. (See [#166](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/issues/166) for the motivation of this change).\r\n   - More concise auxiliary (internal) type name:\r\n     `array_or_vector_selector` -> `array_or_vector`.\r\n   - Remove obsolete parameter `nChecks_IGNORED`. Removed from `SearchParams`\r\n     constructor too, so that structure has been renamed `SearchParameters` to\r\n     enforce users to update the code and avoid mistakes with the order of its\r\n     ctor parameters.\r\n   - Added method RadiusResultSet::empty()\r\n   - Template argument rename: `AccesorType` => `IndexType` (does not actually affect user code at all).\r\n   - Added concurrent tree building support, refer to `KDTreeSingleIndexAdaptorParams::n_thread_build`.\r\n * **Other changes:**\r\n   - Macros to avoid conflicts with X11 symbols.\r\n   - Inline an auxiliary example function in case users want to use it and\r\n    include the file in multiple translation units (Closes [#182](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/issues/182)).\r\n   - Move all benchmarking code, data, and scripts to [its own repository](https://github.com/MRPT/nanoflann-benchmark) to keep this repo as clean as possible.\r\n   - Fix \"potentially uninitialized\" GCC warning.\r\n   - Clarified, even more, in docs and examples, that L2 distances are **squared** distances.\r\n   - Removed the (with modern compilers) now useless `inline` keyword in class members.\r\n   - Add examples with GUI (requires [mrpt-gui](https://docs.mrpt.org/reference/latest/group_mrpt_gui_grp.html)):\r\n     - nanoflann_gui_example_R3: Radius search on R³ Euclidean space.\r\n     - nanoflann_gui_example_bearings: NN search on non-Euclidean spaces.\r\n * BUGFIXES:\r\n     - Avoid segfault if saving an empty index (Closes [#205](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/issues/205)).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jlblancoc/nanoflann/releases/108804077/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":1,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jlblancoc/nanoflann/releases/72682574","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jlblancoc/nanoflann/releases/72682574/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/jlblancoc/nanoflann/releases/72682574/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/releases/tag/v1.4.3","id":72682574,"author":{"login":"jlblancoc","id":5497818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTc4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5497818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc","html_url":"https://github.com/jlblancoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlblancoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOASc_hs4EVQxO","tag_name":"v1.4.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"Release

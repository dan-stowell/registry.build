release with new significant features:\r\n\r\n* Optimized half-to-float and float-to-half conversion, using F16C SSE instruction set if available. Non-SSE conversion eliminates the float-to-half exponent lookup table, and half-to-float conversion provides a compile-time-optional bit shifting algorithm that is slower but eliminates the need for the lookup table, for applications where memory is limited.\r\n\r\n  Half-to-float and float-to-half conversion is also available as C-language functions ``imath_half_to_float()`` and ``imath_float_to_half()``.\r\n  \r\n  All new conversions produced identical results, and new options are off by default to ensure backwards compatibility. See https://imath.readthedocs.io for more info.\r\n  \r\n* ``noexcept`` specifier can be eliminated at compile-time via the ``IMATH_USE_NOEXCEPT`` CMake option.\r\n\r\n* Python bindings:\r\n  * FixedArray objects support a \"read only\" state.\r\n  * FixedArray objects support python buffer protocol.\r\n\r\n* Optimized 4x4 matrix multiplication."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/releases/45321100","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/releases/45321100/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/releases/45321100/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/releases/tag/v3.0.5","id":45321100,"author":{"login":"cary-ilm","id":21344665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzQ0NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21344665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm","html_url":"https://github.com/cary-ilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cary-ilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQ1MzIxMTAw","tag_name":"v3.0.5","target_commitish":"RB-3.0","name":"v3.0.5","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-06-27T15:28:33Z","published_at":"2021-06-30T14:11:15Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/tarball/v3.0.5","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/zipball/v3.0.5","body":"Patch release that fixes problems with library symlinks and pkg-config.

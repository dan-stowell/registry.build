Changes\r\n* Detekt wrapper powering the rule was rewritten from Kotlin to Java. While this is painful, it removes the `rules_kotlin` dependency and associated issues with upgrading to new Kotlin versions (which lead to clashing with Detekt bytecode).\r\n* Enable worker multiplex execution. This should improve execution times by a margin — see #109 for the comparison.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buildfoundation/bazel_rules_detekt/releases/37148332","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buildfoundation/bazel_rules_detekt/releases/37148332/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/buildfoundation/bazel_rules_detekt/releases/37148332/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/buildfoundation/bazel_rules_detekt/releases/tag/v0.4.0","id":37148332,"author":{"login":"arturdryomov","id":200401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDQwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov","html_url":"https://github.com/arturdryomov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arturdryomov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM3MTQ4MzMy","tag_name":"v0.4.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.4.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-01-31T20:36:13Z","published_at":"2021-01-31T20:43:33Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buildfoundation/bazel_rules_detekt/tarball/v0.4.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buildfoundation/bazel_rules_detekt/zipball/v0.4.0","body":"```starlark\r\nrules_detekt_version=\"0.4.0\"\r\nrules_detekt_sha=\"a39020fba766258cdcdbf8f99487304775bd6e43b8b3b967b9961d48b2581fe3\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Support for latest Bazel (4.0.0) and Detekt (1.15.0) versions.

Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* [REMOVAL] Remove build option `WITH_DEPRECATED_SDK_FACTORY`\r\n  [#2717](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2717)\r\n\r\n  * As announced in opentelemetry-cpp previous release 1.16.0,\r\n    CMake option `WITH_DEPRECATED_SDK_FACTORY` was temporary,\r\n    and to be removed by the next release.\r\n  * This option is now removed.\r\n  * Code configuring the SDK must be adjusted, as previously described:\r\n\r\n    * [API/SDK] Provider cleanup\r\n      [#2664](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2664)\r\n\r\n    * Before this fix:\r\n      * SDK factory methods such as:\r\n        * opentelemetry::sdk::trace::TracerProviderFactory::Create()\r\n        * opentelemetry::sdk::metrics::MeterProviderFactory::Create()\r\n        * opentelemetry::sdk::logs::LoggerProviderFactory::Create()\r\n        * opentelemetry::sdk::logs::EventLoggerProviderFactory::Create()\r\n\r\n        returned an API object (opentelemetry::trace::TracerProvider)\r\n          to the caller.\r\n\r\n    * After this fix, these methods return an SDK level object\r\n      (opentelemetry::sdk::trace::TracerProvider) to the caller.\r\n    * Returning an SDK object is necessary for the application to\r\n      cleanup and invoke SDK level methods, such as ForceFlush(),\r\n      on a provider.\r\n    * The application code that configures the SDK, by calling\r\n      the various provider factories, may need adjustment.\r\n    * All the examples have been updated, and in particular no\r\n      longer perform static_cast do convert an API object to an SDK object.\r\n      Please refer to examples for guidance on how to adjust.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @hongweipeng made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2661\r\n* @BYVoid made their first

`ForceFlushWithMicroseconds()`, `Close()`\r\n      and `CloseWithMicroseconds()`.\r\n    * These methods are meant to be used when configuring the SDK,\r\n      and should not be part of the API. Exposing them was an oversight.\r\n    * Two of these methods are virtual, and therefore part of the ABI.\r\n  * After this fix:\r\n    * In `OPENTELEMETRY_ABI_VERSION_NO 1`, nothing is changed,\r\n      because removing this code would break the ABI.\r\n    * In `OPENTELEMETRY_ABI_VERSION_NO 2`, these methods are moved\r\n      from the API to the SDK. This is a breaking change for ABI version 2,\r\n      which is still experimental.\r\n  * In all cases, instrumenting an application should not\r\n    invoke flush or close on a tracer, do not use these methods.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* [API/SDK] Provider cleanup\r\n  [#2664](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2664)\r\n  * Before this fix:\r\n    * SDK factory methods such as:\r\n      * opentelemetry::sdk::trace::TracerProviderFactory::Create()\r\n      * opentelemetry::sdk::metrics::MeterProviderFactory::Create()\r\n      * opentelemetry::sdk::logs::LoggerProviderFactory::Create()\r\n      * opentelemetry::sdk::logs::EventLoggerProviderFactory::Create()\r\n      returned an API object (opentelemetry::trace::TracerProvider)\r\n      to the caller.\r\n  * After this fix, these methods return an SDK level object\r\n    (opentelemetry::sdk::trace::TracerProvider) to the caller.\r\n  * Returning an SDK object is necessary for the application to\r\n    cleanup and invoke SDK level methods, such as ForceFlush(),\r\n    on a provider.\r\n  * The application code that configures the SDK, by calling\r\n    the various provider factories, may need adjustment.\r\n  * All the examples have been updated, and in particular no\r\n    longer perform static_cast do convert an API object to an SDK object.\r\n    Please refer to examples for guidance on how to adjust.\r\n  * If adjusting application code is impractical,\r\n    an alternate and temporary solution is to build with option\r\n    WITH_DEPRECATED_SDK_FACTORY=ON in CMake.\r\n  * Option WITH_DEPRECATED_SDK_FACTORY=ON will allow to build code\r\n    without application changes, posponing changes for later.\r\n  * WITH_DEPRECATED_SDK_FACTORY=ON is temporary, only to provide\r\n    an easier migration path. Expect this flag to be removed,\r\n    as early as by the next release.\r\n\r\n## Notes on experimental features\r\n* [#2372](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/issues/2372)\r\n  introduced `MeterProvider::SetExemplar()` which accepts an\r\n  `ExemplarFilterType` enumeration with `kAlwaysOff`, `kAlwaysOn` and\r\n  `kTraceBased`.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @arekay made

opentelemetry-cpp version 1.15.0 by @marcalff in https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2639\r\n\r\n## Important changes:\r\n\r\n* [EXPORTER] Gzip compression support for OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/gRPC exporter\r\n  [#2530](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2530)\r\n  * In the `OtlpHttpExporterOptions` and `OtlpGrpcExporterOptions`, a new\r\n    field called compression has been introduced. This field can be set\r\n    to \"gzip” to enable gzip compression.\r\n  * The CMake option `WITH_OTLP_HTTP_COMPRESSION` is introduced to enable\r\n    gzip compression support for the OTLP HTTP Exporter and includes a\r\n    dependency on zlib.\r\n* [SDK] Change OTLP HTTP content_type default to binary\r\n  [#2558](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2558)\r\n* [CI] Use platform CMake\r\n  [#2627](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2627)\r\n  * The `CI` in github no longer install a different version of `cmake`.\r\n  * It now always use the `cmake` provided by the platform.\r\n  * As part of this change, the script `ci/setup_cmake.sh` was renamed\r\n    to `ci/setup_googletest.sh`, for clarity, now that this script\r\n    only installs googletest.\r\n* [SDK] DefaultLogHandler to print to std::cerr, add LogLevel::None\r\n  [#2622](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2622)\r\n  * Change DefaultLogHandler output\r\n    * Before, the default internal logger, DefaultLogHandler,\r\n      used to print to std::cout.\r\n    * Now, DefaultLogHandler prints errors and warnings to std::cerr,\r\n      as expected, while printing info and debug messages to std::cout.\r\n    * Applications that expected to find the opentelemetry-cpp internal\r\n      error log in std::cout may need adjustments, either by looking\r\n      at std::cerr instead, or by using a custom log handler.\r\n  * Additional LogLevel::None\r\n    * LogLevel::None is a new supported log level, which does not print\r\n      any message.\r\n    * Custom log handlers may need to implement a new case, to avoid\r\n      compiler warnings.\r\n    * Numbering of log levels like OTEL_INTERNAL_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR\r\n      has changed, which requires to rebuild, as the SDK ABI differs.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @alanwest made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2560\r\n* @keith

[#2371](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2371)\r\n  * TracerProvider::GetTracer() now accepts InstrumentationScope attributes.\r\n  * Because this is an `ABI` breaking change, the fix is only available\r\n    with the `CMake` option `WITH_ABI_VERSION_2=ON`.\r\n  * When building with `CMake` option `WITH_ABI_VERSION_1=ON` (by default)\r\n    the `ABI` is unchanged, and the fix is not available.\r\n\r\n* [API] Add a new AddLink() operation to Span\r\n  [#2380](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2380)\r\n  * New `API` Span::AddLink() adds a single link to a span.\r\n  * New `API` Span::AddLinks() adds multiple links to a span.\r\n  * Because this is an `ABI` breaking change, the fix is only available\r\n    with the `CMake` option `WITH_ABI_VERSION_2=ON`.\r\n  * When building with `CMake` option `WITH_ABI_VERSION_1=ON` (by default)\r\n    the `ABI` is unchanged, and the fix is not available.\r\n\r\n* [BUILD] Make WITH_OTLP_HTTP_SSL_PREVIEW mainstream\r\n  [#2378](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2378)\r\n  * The experimental `CMake` option `WITH_OTLP_HTTP_SSL_PREVIEW`\r\n    is now promoted to stable. The default is changed to `ON`.\r\n  * The experimental `CMake` option `WITH_OTLP_HTTP_SSL_TLS_PREVIEW`\r\n    is now promoted to stable. The default is changed to `ON`.\r\n  * These build options are scheduled to be removed by the next release,\r\n    building without SSL/TLS will no longer be possible.\r\n\r\n* [EXPORTER] Rework OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/GRPC exporter options\r\n  [#2388](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2388)\r\n  * `OtlpGrpcMetricExporterOptions` used to honor `_TRACES_`\r\n    environment variables, instead of `_METRICS_` environment variables.\r\n  * The implementation of `OtlpGrpcMetricExporterOptions` is now fixed.\r\n  * Please check configuration variables,\r\n    to make sure `_METRICS_` variables are set as expected.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* [BUILD] Remove WITH_REMOVE_METER_PREVIEW, use WITH_ABI_VERSION_2 instead\r\n  [#2370](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2370)\r\n  * The experimental `CMake` option `WITH_REMOVE_METER_PREVIEW` is removed,\r\n    use option `WITH_ABI_VERSION_2` instead.\r\n\r\n* [BUILD] enum CanonicalCode names too generic... conflict with old C defines\r\n  [#2385](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2385)\r\n  * Header file `opentelemetry/trace/canonical_code.h` is unused,\r\n    and is now removed.\r\n  * This header should not be included directly in an application.\r\n    If this is the case, please remove any remaining include directives.\r\n\r\n* [BUILD] Fix exported definitions when building DLL with STL\r\n  [#2387](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2387)\r\n  * The MeterSelector, MeterSelectorFactory, InstrumentSelector,\r\n    and InstrumentSelectorFactory APIs now use const std::string&\r\n    instead of nostd::string_view for name, version and schema to\r\n    maintain a single export definition for DLL.\r\n\r\n* [EXPORTER] Rework OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/GRPC exporter options\r\n  [#2388](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2388)\r\n  * `OtlpGrpcLogRecordExporter` incorrectly used `OtlpGrpcExporterOptions`,\r\n    which are options for traces and not logs.\r\n  * This created a bug: the `OtlpGrpcLogRecordExporter` honors `_TRACES_`\r\n    environment variables, instead of `_LOGS_` environment variables.\r\n  * `OtlpGrpcLogRecordExporter` is changed to use\r\n    `OtlpGrpcLogRecordExporterOptions` instead, fixing the bug.\r\n  * User code that initializes the SDK with a GRPC Log exporter,\r\n    and uses exporter options, should adjust to replace\r\n    `OtlpGrpcExporterOptions` with `OtlpGrpcLogRecordExporterOptions`.\r\n  * Please check configuration variables,\r\n    to make sure `_LOGS_` variables are set as expected.\r\n\r\n* [REMOVAL] Remove ZPAGES\r\n  [#2433](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2433)\r\n  * As announced in release 1.12.0,\r\n    the deprecated ZPAGES exporter is now removed.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n*

[RELEASE] Prepare release 1.12.0 by @marcalff in https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2359\r\n\r\n## Important changes\r\n* [API] Add InstrumentationScope attributes in MeterProvider::GetMeter()\r\n  [#2224](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2224)\r\n  * MeterProvider::GetMeter() now accepts InstrumentationScope attributes.\r\n  * Because this is an `ABI` breaking change, the fix is only available\r\n    with the `CMake` option `WITH_ABI_VERSION_2=ON`.\r\n  * When building with `CMake` option `WITH_ABI_VERSION_1=ON` (by default)\r\n    the `ABI` is unchanged, and the fix is not available.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* [BUILD] Need fine-grained HAVE_CPP_STDLIB\r\n  [#2304](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2304)\r\n  * In `CMAKE`, the boolean option `WITH_STL` as changed to an option\r\n    that accepts the values `OFF`, `ON`, `CXX11`, `CXX14`, `CXX17`,\r\n    `CXX20` and `CXX23`.\r\n  * Applications makefiles that did not set WITH_STL need to use\r\n    `WITH_STL=OFF` instead (this is the default).\r\n  * Applications makefiles that did set WITH_STL need to use\r\n    `WITH_STL=ON` instead, or may choose to pick a specific value.\r\n  * In the `API` header files, the preprocessor symbol `HAVE_CPP_STDLIB`\r\n    is no longer used.\r\n  * Applications that did set `HAVE_CPP_STDLIB` before, need to set\r\n    `OPENTELEMETRY_STL_VERSION=<version>` instead, to build with a\r\n    specific STL version (2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, 2023).\r\n  * The opentelemetry-cpp makefile no longer sets\r\n    CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD by itself.\r\n    Instead, the CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD and/or compiler options -stdc++ used\r\n    by the caller are honored.\r\n  * Applications that set neither CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD nor -stdc++\r\n    options may need to provide a C++ standard in their makefiles.\r\n\r\n* [REMOVAL] Drop C++11 support\r\n  [#2342](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2342)\r\n  * Building with C++11 is no longer supported.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @punya made their first contribution in

[#2078](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2078)\r\n\r\n## Important changes:\r\n\r\n* [EXPORTER] GRPC endpoint scheme should take precedence over OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_INSECURE\r\n  [#2060](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2060)\r\n  * The logic to decide whether or not an OTLP GRPC exporter uses SSL has\r\n    changed to comply with the specification:\r\n    * Before this change, the following settings were evaluated, in order:\r\n      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_INSECURE (starting with 1.8.3)\r\n      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE (starting with 1.8.3)\r\n      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_SSL_ENABLE\r\n      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_SSL_ENABLE\r\n    * With this change, the following settings are evaluated, in order:\r\n      * The GRPC endpoint scheme, if provided:\r\n        * \"https\" imply with SSL,\r\n        * \"http\" imply without ssl.\r\n      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_INSECURE\r\n      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE\r\n      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_SSL_ENABLE\r\n      * OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_SSL_ENABLE\r\n    * As a result, a behavior change for GRPC SSL is possible,\r\n      because the endpoint scheme now takes precedence.\r\n      Please verify configuration settings for the GRPC endpoint.\r\n* [SDK] Add `ForceFlush` for all `LogRecordExporter` and `SpanExporter`\r\n  [#2000](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2000)\r\n  * `LogRecordExporter` and `SpanExporter` add a new virtual function\r\n    `ForceFlush`, and if users implement any customized `LogRecordExporter` and\r\n    `SpanExporter`, they should also implement this function.\r\n    There should be no impact if users only use factory to create exporters.\r\n\r\n## New

Notes:\r\n\r\n###  Deprecation notes:\r\n\r\n  * [MAINTAINER DOC] Define and document a deprecation process,\r\n    [#1923](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/1923)\r\n    * A new file, [DEPRECATED](./DEPRECATED.md) list all the code currently\r\n      deprecated.\r\n    * A new [deprecation process](./docs/deprecation-process.md) details the plan to\r\n      deprecate and later remove code.\r\n  * [DEPRECATION] Deprecate the Jaeger exporter\r\n    [#1923](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/1923)\r\n    * The Jaeger Exporter is deprecated, see [DEPRECATED](./DEPRECATED.md) for details.\r\n\r\n ### Important changes:\r\n\r\n  * [BUILD] Cleanup CMake makefiles for CURL usage\r\n    [#1916](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/1916)\r\n    * CMake option `WITH_OTLP_HTTP`\r\n      * Before this change, the CMake option `WITH_OTLP_HTTP` was unpredictable,\r\n        sometime set to ON and sometime set to OFF by default,\r\n        depending on whether a CURL package was found or not.\r\n        The option `WITH_OTLP_HTTP` was sometime not displayed in the ccmake\r\n        UI, making it impossible to even discover there is an option of that name.\r\n      * With this change, CMake option `WITH_OTLP_HTTP` is always OFF by\r\n        default. WITH_OTLP_HTTP MUST be set to ON explicitly to build the\r\n        OTLP HTTP exporter. The option is always visible in the ccmake UI.\r\n    * CMake option `BUILD_W3CTRACECONTEXT_TEST`\r\n      * Before this change, the W3C trace context tests were built, or\r\n        not, in an unpredictable way, depending on the presence, or not, of a\r\n        CURL package. In particular, the build could ignore the W3C trace\r\n        context tests even when BUILD_W3CTRACECONTEXT_TEST=ON.\r\n      * With this change, option BUILD_W3CTRACECONTEXT_TEST is honored.\r\n    * HTTP client/server examples\r\n      * Before this change, the HTTP client/server examples were built, or\r\n        not, in an unpredictable way, depending on the presence, or not, of a\r\n        CURL package.\r\n      * With this change, a new option `WITH_EXAMPLES_HTTP` is used to\r\n        build the HTTP client/server examples.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/releases/90886221/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":14},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/releases/84923728","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/releases/84923728/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/releases/84923728/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/releases/tag/v1.8.1","id":84923728,"author":{"login":"esigo","id":71217171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjE3MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71217171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo","html_url":"https://github.com/esigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esigo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOC4NVL84FD9VQ","tag_name":"v1.8.1","target_commitish":"main","name":"OpenTelemetry

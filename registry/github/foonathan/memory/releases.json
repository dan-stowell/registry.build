The important compatibility workarounds like the `__builtin_clz` extension are still used, but workarounds for missing C++11 library features have been removed. In particular, the library now requires compiler support for `noexcept`, `constexpr`, `alignof` and `thread_local`.This means that GCC 4.8 and Visual Studio version 12.0 (both released in 2013), are no longer supported.\r\n\r\n## Adapter\r\n\r\nBREAKING: Remove `Mutex` support from `allocator_reference` and consequently from `std_allocator`, `allocator_deleter`, etc. Embedding the `Mutex` with the reference was *fundamentally* broken and unusable to ensure thread safety. Use a reference to a `thread_safe_allocator` instead, which actually guarantees thread safety.\r\n\r\n## Allocator\r\n\r\nAdd ability to query the minimal block size required by a `memory_pool` or `memory_stack` that should contain the given memory. Due to internal data structures and debug fences this is more than the naive memory request, so it can be computed now.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* more CMake improvements for cross-compiling, among others\r\n* bugfixes to support UWP (#80), VxWorks (#81) and QNX (#85, #88, among others)\r\n* better support missing container node size (#59, #72, among others)\r\n* fix alignment issues in debug

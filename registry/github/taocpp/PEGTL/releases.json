Use the [**migration guide**](https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL/blob/master/doc/Migration-Guide.md#version-300) when updating.\r\n* Infrastructure\r\n  * Updated required C++ standard to C++17.\r\n  * Updated required [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version to 3.8.\r\n  * The macro `TAO_PEGTL_NAMESPACE` now contains the fully qualified namespace, e.g. `tao::pegtl`.\r\n  * Added `[[nodiscard]]` or `[[noreturn]]` to most non-void functions.\r\n* Meta-Data Layer\r\n  * Replaced `analysis_t` with more general and complete `rule_t` and `subs_t`.\r\n  * Added functions to visit all rules of a grammar.\r\n  * Added functions to measure rule coverage of a parsing run.\r\n  * Moved the analysis function and header to contrib.\r\n* Error Handling\r\n  * Replaced `tao::pegtl::input_error` with `std::system_error` and `std::filesystem::filesystem_error`.\r\n  * Added `must_if<>`\r\n    * Allows to define custom error messages for global errors.\r\n    * Adds a non-intrusive way to define global parse errors for a grammar retroactively.\r\n* Demangling\r\n  * Removed the need for RTTI.\r\n    * Some broken/unknown compilers will use RTTI as a fallback, without demangling.\r\n  * Moved `tao::pegtl::internal::demangle<T>()` to `tao::demangle<T>()`.\r\n  * Improved generated code to be shorter and more efficient.\r\n* Parse Tree\r\n  * Removed the need for RTTI.\r\n* Other\r\n  * Changed `std::string` to `std::filesystem::path` for filename parameters.\r\n  * Renamed `byte_in_line` to `column` and use 1-based counting.\r\n  * Moved rule `eolf` from inline namespace `tao::pegtl::ascii` to `tao::pegtl`.\r\n  * Changed rules in `tao/pegtl/contrib/integer.hpp` to not accept redundant leading zeros.\r\n  * Added rules to `tao/pegtl/contrib/integer.hpp` that test unsigned values against a maximum.\r\n  * Demoted UTF-16 and UTF-32 support to contrib.\r\n  * Demoted UINT-8, UINT-16, UINT-32 and UINT-64 support to contrib.\r\n  * Folded `contrib/counter.hpp` into `json_count.cpp`, count is superceded by coverage.\r\n  * Removed right padding from `contrib/json.hpp`'s `value`.\r\n* Cleanup\r\n  * Removed option of state's `S::success()` to have an extended signature to get access to the current `apply_mode`, `rewind_mode`, *action*- and *control* class (template).\r\n  * Removed compatibility macros starting with `TAOCPP_PEGTL_`.\r\n  * Removed compatibility uppercase enumerators.\r\n  * Removed compatibility `peek_byte()` member functions.\r\n  * Removed compatibility header `changes.hpp` from contrib.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/25788329","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/25788329/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/25788329/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/tag/2.8.3","id":25788329,"author":{"login":"d-frey","id":3956325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTYzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3956325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey","html_url":"https://github.com/d-frey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI1Nzg4MzI5","tag_name":"2.8.3","target_commitish":"2.x","name":"PEGTL

`apply()`/`apply0()`-methods returning boolean values.\r\n* Simplified implementation of `raw_string`, the optional `Contents...` rules' `apply()`/`apply0()`-methods are now called with the original states.\r\n* Fixed the tracer to work with `apply()`/`apply0()`-methods returning boolean values. (Thanks Joel Frederico)\r\n* Fixed, simplified and improved `examples/parse_tree.cpp`.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/8626951","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/8626951/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/8626951/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/tag/2.2.2","id":8626951,"author":{"login":"d-frey","id":3956325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTYzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3956325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey","html_url":"https://github.com/d-frey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTg2MjY5NTE=","tag_name":"2.2.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"PEGTL 2.2.2 \"10th anniversary edition\"","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-11-22T21:20:59Z","published_at":"2017-11-22T21:24:12Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/tarball/2.2.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/zipball/2.2.2","body":"* Fixed missing call to the control class' `failure()`-method when a rule with an `apply()`-method with a boolean return type fails.\r\n* Fixed string handling in `examples/abnf2pegtl.cc`.\r\n* Simplified/improved Android build.\r\n\r\n(this is a re-release of 2.2.1 to fix the version number reported by CMake and `version.hpp`)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/8625959","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/8625959/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/8625959/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL/releases/tag/2.2.1","id":8625959,"author":{"login":"d-frey","id":3956325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTYzMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3956325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey","html_url":"https://github.com/d-frey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-frey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTg2MjU5NTk=","tag_name":"2.2.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"PEGTL 2.2.1 \"10th anniversary edition\"","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-11-22T19:58:16Z","published_at":"2017-11-22T20:04:44Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/tarball/2.2.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/taocpp/PEGTL/zipball/2.2.1","body":"* Fixed missing call to the control class' `failure()`-method when a rule with an `apply()`-method with a boolean return type fails.\r\n* Fixed string handling in `examples/abnf2pegtl.cc`.\r\n* Simplified/improved Android build.\r\n"}]

I.e. one publisher can send data to several subscribers. But a subscriber could not receive data from more than one publisher. With the n:m feature this limitation is resolved \r\n* **MacOS support**\r\nSo far iceoryx supported Linux and QNX as underlying operating systems. We now introduce a platform abstraction layer and support for MacOS \r\n* **Refactoring of public API**\r\niceoryx is normally used within a bigger framework that provides user APIs. To better support users that are using iceoryx directly and to further simplify the integration of iceoryx in other frameworks, we do a refactoring of the API \r\n* **Bridge to Eclipse Cyclone DDS**\r\niceoryx is a technology for inter-process-communication. It has to be extended when it is used in a framework that shall also support network communication. We have building blocks that allow developing bridges to protocols for network communication.

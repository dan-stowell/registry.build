5.0.0 release introduces support for [Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/overview) and drops support for WORKSPACE. This has required a large restructure of the repo, with the code being split into multiple modules. A 'core' module provides common types and compilation support, whilst per-language modules provide the integration with each language's specific third-party modules and tools. Moving to Bzlmod provides a huge improvement in the stability and maintainability of these rules, as third-party transitive dependency management has been handed off to Bazel and new versions of gRPC and Protobuf should hopefully be able to be supported more rapidly.\r\n\r\nAt present, a limited number of languages have been migrated from the 4.x.x releases, with support for the remaining languages being tracked [here](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/299). For these unsupported languages - or for WORKSPACE repos - it is recommended you continue using the 4.x.x releases.\r\n\r\nThe way you use these rules is largely unchanged, but unfortunately the paths used for `load` of the rules will have changed due to the splitting into language-specific modules. For example, the following load:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nload(\"@rules_proto_grpc//go:defs.bzl\", \"go_proto_library\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill become:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nload(\"@rules_proto_grpc_go//:defs.bzl\", \"go_proto_library\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nDetails on the new rule loads can, as always, be found on each language's page in the documentation. Examples for each language are also provided in the repo's [examples](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/tree/master/examples) directory.\r\n\r\nSome key other changes include:\r\n\r\n- The versions of gRPC and Protobuf are updated to the latest available in\r\n  [Bazel Central Registry](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry)\r\n- Python now pulls

For most users, 4.0.0 will be a drop-in replacement to the 3.x.x releases and the updates for each language are shown below. Should you have any issues with the new release, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/new) or [discussion](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/discussions/new).\r\n\r\nThe following changes are considered 'breaking', requiring the step to the 4.x.x release cycle:\r\n\r\n- The transitive aspect-based compilation mode using the ``deps`` attribute is now completely removed. This mode was deprecated in 3.0.0 and all use of the transitive mode will have shown a warning. If all of your uses of rules_proto_grpc use the ``protos`` attribute, 4.0.0 will be no different from 3.x.x. See [here](https://rules-proto-grpc.com/en/latest/transitivity.html) for further details. If you have written your own rules for a custom plugin, please see the updated and simplified rule template.\r\n\r\n- The ``//nodejs`` aliases for the ``//js`` rules have been removed. Again, these were deprecated in the 3.x.x cycle and printed a warning when used. If you are still using these aliases, you can simply change your imports to use the ``//js`` prefixed rules.\r\n\r\n- The Rust rules have switched gRPC implementation to [grpc](https://crates.io/crates/grpc>). In 3.x.x, we used `grpc-rs`/`grpcio`, which wraps the C/C++ implementation of gRPC directly. However, the wrapping process was extremely error prone, with updates of either Rust rules or gRPC causing linker failures and significant maintenance burden. Should you still need `grpcio` crate support, the 3.1.1 release continues to work but may have issues with newer gRPC versions. The replacement `grpc` crate is self-described as 'not suitable for production use' but is more readily supportable by these rules in the short term. In the longer term, support for [prost](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost) and [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) is also on the roadmap, but is [waiting for protoc plugins](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/143>) to be available.\r\n\r\n- When using JavaScript library rules, the require path for generated files no longer includes the ``<target_name>_pb`` path segment by default. For the previous behaviour, set ``legacy_path = True`` on the library. #107\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n- Updated protobuf to 3.18.0\r\n- Updated grpc to 1.40.0\r\n- Updated ``rules_proto`` to 4.0.0\r\n- Documentation has moved to [rules-proto-grpc.com](https://rules-proto-grpc.com). Existing links to the old location will continue to work\r\n- Transitive aspect-based compilation has been removed\r\n- The ``output_files`` attribute of ``ProtoCompileInfo`` has changed from a dict of depsets to a single depset. This is generally an internal implementation detail, so is unlikely to affect any rule users.\r\n\r\n### C\r\n\r\n- Updated ``upb`` to latest\r\n\r\n### C#/F#\r\n\r\n- Added F# support. #127\r\n- Updated gRPC to 2.40.0\r\n\r\n### D\r\n\r\n- Updated ``rules_d`` to latest\r\n\r\n### Doc\r\n\r\n- Updated ``protoc-gen-doc`` to 1.5.0\r\n- Added ``doc_template_compile`` to generate output using a custom Go template file.\r\n\r\n### Go\r\n\r\n- Updated ``rules_go`` to v0.28.0\r\n- Added validator rules using [protoc-gen-validate](https://github.com/envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate). #16\r\n\r\n### grpc-gateway\r\n\r\n- Updated ``grpc-gateway`` to 2.6.0\r\n\r\n### Java\r\n\r\n- Updated ``grpc-java`` to 1.40.1\r\n\r\n### JavaScript\r\n\r\n- **Breaking change**: The require path for generated files no longer includes the ``<target_name>_pb`` path segment by default. For the previous behaviour, set ``legacy_path = True`` on the library. #107\r\n- Added ``package_name`` attribute to library rules, which allows customising the package name of the generated library. By default if unspecified, the target name will continue to be used as in previous versions.\r\n- Updated ``rules_nodejs`` to 4.2.0\r\n- Updated ``@grpc/grpc-js`` to 1.3.7\r\n- Updated ``grpc-tools`` to 1.11.2\r\n- Updated ``ts-protoc-gen`` to 0.15.0\r\n\r\n### Python\r\n\r\n- Updated ``rules_python`` to 0.4.0\r\n- Updated ``six`` to 1.16.0\r\n\r\n### Ruby\r\n\r\n- Updated ``rules_ruby`` to 0.5.2\r\n- **WORKSPACE update needed**: The ``ruby_bundle`` call in your workspace needs an extra ``include`` attribute for grpc to work as expected. Please see the Ruby examples\r\n\r\n### Rust\r\n\r\n- Updated ``rules_rust`` to latest\r\n- **Breaking change**: Replaced ``grpcio`` with ``grpc``. Please see above description for full details on why ``grpcio`` is no longer supportable and the long term aim to support prost and tonic\r\n- Updated ``protobuf`` and ``protobuf-codegen`` to 2.25.1\r\n\r\n### Scala\r\n\r\n- Updated ``rules_scala`` to latest\r\n- Updated ``ScalaPB`` to 0.11.5\r\n- **WORKSPACE update needed**: Dependencies are now fetched with ``maven_install``. You will need to update your WORKSPACE to match the current example.\r\n\r\n### Swift\r\n\r\n- Updated ``rules_swift`` to 0.23.0\r\n- Updated ``grpc-swift`` to 1.4.1\r\n- Updated ``swift-log`` to 1.4.2\r\n- Updated ``swift-nio`` to 2.32.3\r\n- Updated ``swift-nio-extra`` to 1.10.2\r\n- Updated ``swift-nio-http2`` to 1.18.3\r\n- Updated ``swift-nio-ssl`` to 2.15.1\r\n- Updated ``swift-nio-transport-services`` to 1.11.3\r\n\r\n### TypeScript\r\n\r\n- The default mode for TypeScript gRPC compilation has changed to ``grpc-js``. This means imports should now use ``@grpc/grpc-js`` instead of ``grpc``

However, in doing so there have been some changes that make a major version increment necessary and may require\r\nupdates to your build files. The updates for each language are explained below and should you have any issues, please\r\nopen a new [issue](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/new) or\r\n[discussion](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/discussions/new).\r\n\r\nThe most substantial change is that compilation of .proto files into language specific files is no longer transitive.\r\nThis means that only the direct dependencies of a `lang_proto_library` will be present within the generated library,\r\nrather than every transitive proto message. The justification for this is below, but if you're just interested in the\r\nchanges, you can skip down to the next heading.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of rules_proto_grpc, the compilation aspect would compile and aggregate all dependent .proto files\r\nfrom any top level target. In hindsight, this was not the correct behaviour and led to many bugs, since you may end up\r\ncreating a library that contains compiled proto files from a third party, where you should instead be depending on a\r\nproper library for that third party's protos.\r\n\r\nEven in a single repo, this may have meant multiple copies of a single compiled proto file being present in a target, if\r\nit is depended on via multiple routes. For some languages, such as C++, this breaks the 'one definition rule' and\r\nproduces compilation failures or runtime bugs. For other languages, such as Python, this just meant unnecessary\r\nduplicate files in the output binaries.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in this release of rules_proto_grpc, there is now a recommedned option to bundle only the direct proto\r\ndependencies into  the libraries, without including the compiled transitive proto files. This is done by replacing the\r\n`deps` attr on `lang_{proto|grpc}_{compile|library}` with the `protos` attr. Since this would be a substantial breaking\r\nchange to drop at once on a large project, the new behaviour is opt-in in 3.0.0 and the old method continues to work\r\nthroughout the 3.x.x release cycle. Rules using the previous deps attr will have a warning written to console to signify\r\nthat your library may be bundling more than expect and should switch attr.\r\n\r\nAs an additional benefit of this change, we can now support passing arbitrary per-target rules to protoc through the new\r\n`options` attr of the rules, which was a much sought after change that was impossible in the aspect based compilation.\r\n\r\n### Switching to non-transitive compilation\r\n\r\nIn short, replace `deps` with `protos` on your targets:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\n# Old\r\npython_grpc_library(\r\n    name = \"routeguide\",\r\n    deps = [\"//example/proto:routeguide_proto\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\n# New\r\npython_grpc_library(\r\n    name = \"routeguide\",\r\n    protos = [\"//example/proto:routeguide_proto\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn applying the above change, you may discover that you were inheriting dependencies transitively and that your builds\r\nnow fail. In such cases, you should add a `lang_{proto|grpc}_{compile|library}` target for those proto files and\r\ndepend on it explicitly from the relevant top level binaries/libraries.\r\n\r\n### General Changes\r\n- Updated protobuf to 3.15.1\r\n- Updated gRPC to 1.35.0\r\n- All rules have new per-target `options` and `extra_protoc_args` attributes to control options to protoc\r\n  [#54](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/54)\r\n  [#68](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/68)\r\n  [#105](https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/issues/105)\r\n- Updated `rules_proto` to latest head\r\n- `aspect.bzl` and `plugin.bzl` have merged to a single top level `defs.bzl`\r\n- The minimum supported Bazel version is 3.0.0.

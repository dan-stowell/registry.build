As usual, it contains numerous bug fixes, compatibility improvements, and new features.\r\n\r\nThis is expected to be the final release in the libgit2 v1.x lineage. libgit2 v2.0 is expected to be the next version, with support for SHA256 moving to \"supported\" status (out of \"experimental\" status). This means that v2.0 will have API and ABI changes to support SHA256, as well as other [breaking changes](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/discussions/6988).\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\n* **Documentation improvements**\r\n  We've launched a new website for our API reference docs at [https://libgit2.org/docs/reference/main](https://libgit2.org/docs/reference/main/). To support this, we've updated the documentation to ensure that all APIs are well-documented, and added docurium-style specifiers to indicate more depth about the API surface.\r\n\r\n  We now also publish a JSON blob with the API structure and the documentation that may be helpful for binding authors.\r\n\r\n* **TLS cipher updates**\r\n  libgit2 has updated our TLS cipher selection to match the \"compatibility\" cipher suite settings as [documented by Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS).\r\n\r\n* **Blame improvements**\r\n  The blame API now contains committer information and commit summaries for blame hunks, and the ability to get information about the line of text that was modified. In addition, a CLI blame command has been added so that the blame functionality can be benchmarked by our benchmark suite.\r\n\r\n* **More CLI commands**\r\n  libgit2 has added `blame` and `init` commands, which have allowed for [further benchmarking](https://benchmarks.libgit2.org/) and several API improvements and git compatibility updates.\r\n\r\n* **Warning when configuring without SHA1DC**\r\n  Users are encouraged to use SHA1DC, which is _git's hash_; **users should not use SHA1 in the general case**. Users will now be warned if they try to configure cmake with a SHA1 backend (`-DUSE_SHA1=...`).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nThere are several ABI-breaking changes that integrators, particularly maintainers of bindings or FFI users, may want to be aware of.\r\n\r\n* **Blame hunk structure updates** (ABI breaking change)\r\n  There are numerous additions to the `git_blame_hunk` structure to accommodate more information about the blame process.\r\n\r\n* **Checkout strategy updates** (ABI breaking change)\r\n  The values for `GIT_CHECKOUT_SAFE` and `GIT_CHECKOUT_NONE` have been updated. `GIT_CHECKOUT_SAFE` is now `0`; this was implicitly the default value (with the options constructors setting that as the checkout strategy). It is now the default if the checkout strategy is set to `0`. This allows for an overall code simplification in the library.\r\n\r\n* **Configuration entry member removal** (ABI breaking change)\r\n  The `git_config_entry` structure no longer contains a `free` member; this was an oversight as end-users should not try to free that structure.\r\n\r\n* **Configuration backend function changes** (ABI breaking change)\r\n  `git_config_backend`s should now return `git_config_backend_entry` objects instead of `git_config_entry` objects. This allows backends to provide a mechanism to nicely free the configuration entries that they provide.\r\n\r\n* **`update_refs` callback for remotes** (ABI breaking change)\r\n    The `update_refs` callback was added to the `git_remote_callbacks` structure to provide additional information about updated refs; in particular, the `git_refspec` is included for more information about the remote ref. The `update_refs` callback will be preferred over the now deprecated `update_tips` callback.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* The `git_signature_default_from_env` API will now produce a pair of `git_signature`s representing the author, and the committer, taking the `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` environment variables into account. Added by @u-quark in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6706\r\n\r\n* packbuilder can now be interrupted from a callback. Added @roberth in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6874\r\n\r\n* libgit2 now claims to honor the `preciousObject` repository extension. This extension indicates that the client will never delete objects (in other words, will not garbage collect). libgit2 has no functionality to remove objects, so it implicitly obeys this in all cases. Added by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6886\r\n\r\n* Push status will be reported even when a push fails. This is useful to give information from the server about possible updates, even when the overall status failed. Added by @yerseg in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6876\r\n\r\n* You can now generate a thin pack from a mempack instance using `git_mempack_write_thin_pack`. Added by @roberth in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6875\r\n\r\n* The new `LIBGIT2_VERSION_CHECK` macro will indicate whether the version of libgit2 being compiled against is at least the version specified. For example: `#if LIBGIT2_VERSION_CHECK(1, 6, 3)` is true for libgit2 version 1.6.3 or newer. In addition, the new `LIBGIT2_VERSION_NUMBER` macro will return an integer version representing the libgit2 version number. For example, for version 1.6.3, `LIBGIT2_VERSION_NUMBER` will evaluate to `010603`. Added by @HamedMasafi in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6882\r\n\r\n* Custom X509 certificates can be added to OpenSSL's certificate store using the `GIT_OPT_ADD_SSL_X509_CERT` option. Added by @yerseg in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6877\r\n\r\n* The libgit2 compatibility CLI now has a `git blame` command. Added by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6907\r\n\r\n* Remote callbacks now provide an `update_refs` callback so that users can now get the `refspec` of the updated reference during push. This gives more complete information about the remote reference that was updated. Added by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6559\r\n\r\n* An optional FIPS-compliant mode for hashing is now available; you can set `-DUSE_SHA256=OpenSSL-FIPS` to enable it. Added by @marcind-dot in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6906\r\n\r\n* The git-compatible CLI now supports the `git init` command, which has been useful in identifying API improvements and incompatibilities with git. Added by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6984\r\n\r\n* Consumers can now query more information about how libgit2 was compiled, and query the \"backends\" that libgit2 uses. Added by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6971\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix constness issue introduced in #6716 by @ethomson in

is release v1.8.0, \"Das Fliegende Klassenzimmer\". This release includes optional, experimental support for invoking OpenSSH to fetch and push, an easier mechanism to perform the default behavior of `git commit`, and has many improvements for worktrees. This release also includes many other new features and bugfixes.\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\n* **Executable SSH (OpenSSH) support**\r\n   libgit2 can now invoke the command-line OpenSSH to fetch from and push to remotes over SSH. This support takes the place of libssh2 support. To use it, configure libgit2 with `cmake -DUSE_SSH=exec`, and please report any problems that you discover. By @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6617\r\n\r\n* **Simplified commit creation**\r\n   The `git_commit_create_from_stage` API was introduced to allow users to better emulate the behavior of `git commit` without needing to provide unnecessary information. The current state of the index is committed to the current branch. By @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6716\r\n\r\n* **Worktree improvements**\r\n   A number of worktree improvements have been made for better compatibility with core git. First, libgit2 now understands per-worktree references, thanks to @csware in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6387. Worktree-specific configuration is now supported, thanks to @vermiculus in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6202. And improved compatibility with `git worktree add` is now supported, thanks to @herrerog in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/5319.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* **Adding `WORKTREE` configuration level** (ABI breaking change)\r\n  To support worktree configurations at the appropriate level (higher priority than local configuration, but lower priority than app-specific configuration), the `GIT_CONFIG_LEVEL_WORKTREE` level was introduced at priority 6. `GIT_CONFIG_LEVEL_APP` now begins at priority 7.\r\n\r\n* **Changes to `git_config_entry`** (ABI breaking change) The `git_config_entry` structure now contains information about the `backend_type` and `origin_path`. The unused `payload` value has been removed.\r\n\r\n* **`git_push_options` includes remote push options** (ABI breaking change)\r\n  The `git_push_options` structure now contains a value for remote push options.\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n* config: provide an \"origin\" for config entries by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6615\r\n* cli: add a `git config` command by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6616\r\n* Add OpenSSH support by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6617\r\n* remote: optionally report

state by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6707\r\n* commit: introduce git_commit_create_from_stage by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6716\r\n* set SSH timeout

This release adds shallow clone support, completes the experimental SHA256 support, adds Schannel support for Windows, and includes many other newj features and bugfixes.\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\n* **Shallow clone support**\r\n  libgit2 now supports shallow clone and shallow repositories, thanks to a significant investment from many community members -- hundreds of commits by many contributors.\r\n  * Shallow (#6396) with some fixes from review by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6557\r\n  * Shallow Clone Support by @lya001 in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6396\r\n  * Shallow support v2 by @pks-t in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/5254\r\n\r\n* **SHA256 support**\r\n  libgit2 should now support SHA256 repositories using the `extensions.objectFormat` configuration option when the library is built with `EXPERIMENTAL_SHA256=ON`. Users are encouraged to begin testing their applications with this option and provide bug reports and feedback. This _is_ a breaking API change; SHA256 support will be enabled by default in libgit2 v2.0.\r\n\r\n  * sha256: less hardcoded SHA1 types and lengths by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6549\r\n  * Support SHA256 in git_repository_wrap_odb by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6556\r\n\r\n* **Schannel and SSPI for Windows**\r\n  libgit2 now supports the Windows Schannel and SSPI APIs for HTTPS support on Windows, when configured with `USE_HTTPS=Schannel`. Setting this option will not use the existing WinHTTP support, but will use libgit2's standard HTTP client stack with Windows TLS primitives. Windows users are encouraged to begin testing their applications with this option and provide bug reports and feedback. This will be enabled by default in a future version of libgit2.\r\n  * Introduce Schannel and SSPI for Windows by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6533\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* **Simplify custom pluggable allocator** (System API / ABI breaking change)\r\n  The `git_allocator` structure (configurable by the `GIT_OPT_SET_ALLOCATOR` option) now only contains `gmalloc`, `grealloc` and `gfree` members. This simplifies both the work needed by an implementer _and_ allows more flexibility and correctness in libgit2 itself, especially during out-of-memory situations and errors during bootstrapping.\r\n\r\n  * tests: add allocator with limited number of bytes by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6563\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n* repo:

This release adds experimental SHA256 support and includes many new features and bugfixes. This release replaces libgit2 v1.6.0, which did not correctly update its version number(s).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* **Support for bare repositories with SHA256 support (experimental)** by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6191\r\n   You can configure experimental SHA256 support in libgit2 with `cmake -DEXPERIMENTAL_SHA256=ON` during project setup. This is useful for considering future integrations, work on clients, and work on language bindings. At present, working with bare repositories should largely work, including remote operations. But many pieces of functionality - including working with the index - are not yet supported. As a result, **libgit2 with SHA256 support should not be used in production or released with package distribution.**\r\n\r\n* **Support the notion of a home directory separately from global configuration directory** by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6455 and https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6456\r\n  Callers and language bindings can now configure the home directory that libgit2 uses for file lookups (eg, the `.ssh` directory). This configuration is separate from the git global configuration path.\r\n\r\n* **stash: partial stash specific files** by @gitkraken-jacobw in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6330\r\n  A stash can be created with only specific files, using a pathspec. This is similar to the `git stash push` command.\r\n\r\n* **push: revparse refspec source, so you can push things that are not refs** by @sven-of-cord in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6362\r\n  Pushes can be performed using refspecs instead of only references.\r\n\r\n* **Support OpenSSL3** by @ethomson in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6464 and https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6471\r\n  OpenSSL 3 is now supported, both when compiled directly and dynamically loaded.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n* winhttp: support long custom headers by @kcsaul in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6363\r\n* Fix memory leak by @csware in https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6382\r\n* Don't

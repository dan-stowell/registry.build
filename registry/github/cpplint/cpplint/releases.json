Sorry this took so long.\r\n\r\n## What's changed\r\n* üëæ The false positive for indented function parameters in namespaces was eradicated. (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/304)\r\n  * There is another known false positive for member initializer lists, whose fix will arrive soon! Hopefully.\r\n* üõ∞Ô∏è The project was modernized with a migration to pyproject.toml, pre-commit, ruff, and other tooling courtesy of @cclauss, who has returned as a maintainer! This includes updating the code to conform with several newly-introduced linter checks.\r\n* ‚Ü™Ô∏è Files that end in \".c\", \".C\", or \".cu\" will now also automatically suppress C++-only lint categories. Previously, `// NO_LINT_C` was required. (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/318)\r\n* üßë build/include-what-you-use now recognizes c-style headers such as <stdio.h> for symbols from \\<cstdio>. (https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/pull/319)\r\n* üìú @Hs293Go fixed an embarrassing typo in the list of recognized C++ headers.

Changes:\r\n\r\n* The `is_e_type` trait is deleted. Any value type can be used as an error type.\r\n* Error handlers can now be captured in a tuple and used with `try_handle_some`, `try_handle_all` or `try_catch`. The `remote_` prefixed error handling functions are removed.\r\n* `preload`, `defer`, and `accumulate` are all merged into a single API called `on_error`.\r\n* `match` is now compatible with `std::error_code`, e.g. `match<std::error_code, 42>`.\r\n* Error handlers that take arguments of exception types will automatically catch exceptions; `catch_` is now optional, primarily used to catch more than one exception type.\r\n* Error handlers can now take mutable reference (and mutable pointer) arguments.\r\n* `augment_id` is renamed to `error_monitor`.\r\n* All `LEAF_XXXX` macros are renamed to `BOOST_LEAF_XXXX`."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boostorg/leaf/releases/21710361","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boostorg/leaf/releases/21710361/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/boostorg/leaf/releases/21710361/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/boostorg/leaf/releases/tag/0.2.5","id":21710361,"author":{"login":"zajo","id":609498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo","html_url":"https://github.com/zajo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zajo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIxNzEwMzYx","tag_name":"0.2.5","target_commitish":"master","name":"Configuration

is a major new release. The most significant change is that the parser now returns an object with the parse result, and does not modify `argc` or `argv`. The result object does not depend on the parser, so the following is now possible:\r\n```cpp\r\nauto result = options.parse(argc, argv);\r\nreturn result;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* Only search for a C++ compiler in CMakeLists.txt.\r\n* Allow for exceptions to be disabled.\r\n* Fix duplicate default options when there is a short and long option.\r\n* Add `CXXOPTS_NO_EXCEPTIONS` to disable exceptions.\r\n* Fix char parsing for space and check for length.\r\n* Change argument type in `Options::parse` from `char**` to `const char**`.\r\n* Refactor parser to not change its arguments.\r\n* `ParseResult` doesn't depend on a reference to the parser.\r\n* Fixed several warnings and code quality issues.\r\n* Improved formatting for help descriptions.\r\n* Improve integer parsing.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* A list of unmatched arguments is available in `ParseResult`.\r\n* Support single letter options with argument attached.\r\n* Use <optional> if it is present.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix missing option name in exception."}]

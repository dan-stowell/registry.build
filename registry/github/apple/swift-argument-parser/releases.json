Please note: numerous longstanding issues still remain in the completion scripts (mainly involving quoting/escaping); they will be fixed over time.

Users of older Swift versions will be able to continue using version 1.2.3 of the library. (#582)\r\n\r\n### Additions\r\n\r\n- Help screens now include possible options for `ExpressibleByArgument` types with non empty `allValueStrings`. Types also conforming to `CaseIterable` do not need to manually implement `allValueStrings`, instead it is derived from `allCases`. (#594)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- The titles for nested option groups are preserved when embedded into commands without specifying a new title. (#592)\r\n- When wrapping help and error messages, the library now uses the `COLUMNS` environment variable when set, instead of immediately falling back to 80 columns. (#596)\r\n- Bash completion scripts now respect the extensions given in a `.file(...)` completion kind. (#590)\r\n- Bash completion scripts now properly escape command names that include hyphens. (#573)\r\n- Documentation improvements. (#572, #565, #602)\r\n\r\nThe 1.2.3 release includes contributions from @Alkenso, @compnerd, @gwynne,\r\n@kennyyork, @natecook1000, @rauhul, @robertmryan, and @vlm.

(#496)\r\n- Default values are now supported for `@Argument` or `@Option` properties with optional type, allowing you to initialize those properties with `nil`.

(#496)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Invalid `init(from:)` decoding initializers are now correctly diagnosed by ArgumentParser's validators.

(#486)\r\n- The help display for non-string-backed raw representable types has been corrected to not show raw Swift values.

The official supported list of targets is included. A number of wrapper Starlark functions are defined to protect the rules from using the non-supported targets.\r\n* Implemented automatic detection of libraries the local LLVM installation is depend on (including the  [Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). No additional environment variables such as `Z3_INSTALL_PREFIX` is required.\r\n* The bridge can download a binary or source LLVM distribution and generate or use a pre-defined `BUILD` file for it. This feature allows using of the bridge in, for example, Tensorflow to build LLVM from sources or download a pre-built package. Also some names of generated targets have been changed to be aligned with targets from Tensorflow.\r\n* Added dealing with the *libc++* standard library: the library binaries can be used as dependencies and there is an array of compiler options to enable *libc++* as default standard library for a rule.\r\n\r\n**How to use in WORKSPACE**\r\n\r\n```bzl\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"bazel_llvm_bridge\",\r\n    sha256 = \"6a4b23ec794d2f4764fc15e2baebf2bae48c0c6bf97df83ba775c04511e91bca\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"bazel-llvm-bridge-pre-release-10-02\",\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/samolisov/bazel-llvm-bridge/archive/pre-release/10-02.zip\",\r\n)\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samolisov/bazel-llvm-bridge/releases/20212557","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samolisov/bazel-llvm-bridge/releases/20212557/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/samolisov/bazel-llvm-bridge/releases/20212557/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/samolisov/bazel-llvm-bridge/releases/tag/release/9-01","id":20212557,"author":{"login":"samolisov","id":134115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDExNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov","html_url":"https://github.com/samolisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samolisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTIwMjEyNTU3","tag_name":"release/9-01","target_commitish":"master","name":"Build 0.1 for LLVM's release 9","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-09-24T12:26:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T14:16:35Z","published_at":"2019-09-24T13:47:05Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samolisov/bazel-llvm-bridge/tarball/release/9-01","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samolisov/bazel-llvm-bridge/zipball/release/9-01","body":"Build 0.1 for LLVM's release 9.\r\n\r\n**Changelog**\r\n\r\n* Implemented support for [Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

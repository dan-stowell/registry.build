request body. Now, an exception will be thrown if a clientId is specified for Cloud Shell managed identity.\r\n\r\n### Bugs Fixed\r\n\r\n- Fixed the request sent in `AzurePipelinesCredential` so it doesn't result in a redirect response when an invalid system access token is provided.\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n\r\n- Allow certain response headers to be logged in `AzurePipelinesCredential` for diagnostics and include them in the exception message.\r\n- In `ClientCertificateCredential`, add the x5c parameter of the JWT token as a JSON array rather than a JSON string.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/releases/178294275","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/releases/178294275/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/releases/178294275/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/releases/tag/azure-core_1.14.0","id":178294275,"author":{"login":"azure-sdk","id":53356347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzU2MzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53356347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk","html_url":"https://github.com/azure-sdk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azure-sdk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODeWLh84KoI4D","tag_name":"azure-core_1.14.0","target_commitish":"1289063cc2a7ba01fa7a8c7cd92155ef401c4cba","name":"azure-core_1.14.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-10-03T18:29:28Z","published_at":"2024-10-03T20:28:11Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/tarball/azure-core_1.14.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/zipball/azure-core_1.14.0","body":"## 1.14.0 (2024-10-03)\r\n\r\n### Features Added\r\n\r\n- Added a new constructor for `Azure::Core::Context` that takes an `Azure::DateTime` deadline.

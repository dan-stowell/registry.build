version:\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.3.0\")\nnode = use_extension(\"@rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\nnode.toolchain(node_version =

you get the node version from DEFAULT_NODE_VERSION in @rules_nodejs//nodejs:repositories.bzl\r\n# Optionally you can pin a different node version:\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_nodejs\", version = \"6.1.0\")\r\nnode = use_extension(\"@rules_nodejs//nodejs:extensions.bzl\", \"node\", dev_dependency = True)\r\nnode.toolchain(node_version = \"16.14.2\")\r\n#################################\r\n\r\nnpm = use_extension(\"@aspect_rules_js//npm:extensions.bzl\", \"npm\", dev_dependency = True)\r\n\r\nnpm.npm_translate_lock(\r\n    name =

use_extension(\"@aspect_rules_js//npm:extensions.bzl\", \"pnpm\")\r\n\r\n# Allows developers to use the matching pnpm version, for example:\r\n# bazel run -- @pnpm --dir /home/runner/work/rules_js/rules_js install\r\nuse_repo(pnpm, \"pnpm\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using WORKSPACE\r\n\r\nPaste this snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"aspect_rules_js\",\r\n    sha256 =

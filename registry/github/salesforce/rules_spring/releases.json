This replaces the previous default behavior, which was to use `JAVA_HOME`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are two new options for overriding this behavior.  See the [launcher JVM docs](https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/blob/main/springboot/bazelrun.md#launcher-jvm)  for more details.\r\n\r\n**Javax => Jakarta Migration Support**\r\n\r\nThis release includes a new **javax detector** that is not enabled by default.  It detects any jar in the `springboot` dependency graph that contains a class from a *javax* package.  It consults an ignorelist (that you provide) to determine if this is known jar.  If not, it will fail the build.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't heard of the javax -> jakarta migration that is up-ending the Java community, this may seem like a strange feature.  For more information, please see [our new docs](https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/blob/main/springboot/javax.md) on this topic. The javax -> jakarta migration (which is required for Spring Boot 3), and the new detector feature, are explained there.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/128009270/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/126709775","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/126709775/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/126709775/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/tag/2.2.5-M2","id":126709775,"author":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBsP4ss4HjXAP","tag_name":"2.2.5-M2","target_commitish":"main","name":"2.2.5-M2 October 2023 Bazel Run JVM","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2023-10-26T04:59:51Z","published_at":"2023-10-26T05:06:02Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/assets/132406129","id":132406129,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBsP4ss4H5Ftx","name":"rules-spring-2.2.5-M2.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":441403,"download_count":60,"created_at":"2023-10-26T05:05:07Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T05:05:08Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/download/2.2.5-M2/rules-spring-2.2.5-M2.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/tarball/2.2.5-M2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/zipball/2.2.5-M2","body":"This release enhances the `springboot` rule such that the JVM used to launch the service from `bazel run` will now use the JVM from the current java toolchain in the workspace, by default.

release fixes a difference that could arise when building the Spring Boot jar on different platforms (Linux, Mac). Spring Boot loader seems to use the order of insertion into the Spring Boot executable jar as the classloading order at runtime. Therefore we need to be more explicit about the order in which entries are inserted into the Spring Boot executable, and not leave it to the platform implementation of *jar* to determine the order. More details are in Issue #72.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/35322873","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/35322873/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/35322873/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/tag/1.0.8","id":35322873,"author":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM1MzIyODcz","tag_name":"1.0.8","target_commitish":"master","name":"1.0.8 December 2020 Features, Features, Features","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-12-15T23:59:37Z","published_at":"2020-12-16T00:22:45Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/assets/29607660","id":29607660,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDI5NjA3NjYw","name":"bazel-springboot-rule-1.0.8.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"plaird","id":921358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/921358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird","html_url":"https://github.com/plaird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plaird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":70892,"download_count":30,"created_at":"2020-12-16T00:15:10Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T00:15:12Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring/releases/download/1.0.8/bazel-springboot-rule-1.0.8.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/tarball/1.0.8","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salesforce/rules_spring/zipball/1.0.8","body":"This is a pre-release of the [1.1.0 planned release](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-springboot-rule/projects/4) (coming soon).

non-Sized, non-Bounded RandomAccess range (eg., a null-terminated string) no longer satisfies SizedRange.\r\n    * The `generate` and `generate_n` views now return the generated values by xvalue reference (`T &&`) to the value cached within the view (see [#905](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/issues/905)).\r\n    * Views no longer prefer returning constant iterators when they can; some views have different constant and mutable iterators.\r\n  - Enhancements:\r\n    * Views can successfully adapt other views that have different constant and mutable iterators.\r\n    * The `single`, `empty`, and `reverse` views are much closer to the versions as specified in [P0896](http://wg21.link/P0896).\r\n  - Bug fixes:\r\n    * \"single_view should not copy the value\"

The new\r\n  `ranges::is_swappable_with<T, U>` tests whether `T` and `U` are swappable.\r\n  `ranges::is_swappable<T>` is equivalent to `ranges::is_swappable_with<T &, T &>`.\r\n- The following object concepts have changed to conform with the Ranges TS\r\n  specification, and approved changes (see [P0547](http://wg21.link/p0547)):\r\n  * `Destructible`\r\n  * `Constructible`\r\n  * `DefaultConstructible`\r\n  * `MoveConstructible`\r\n  * `CopyConstructible`\r\n  * `Movable`\r\n  * `Assignable`\r\n- The `View` concept is no longer satisfied by reference types.\r\n- `is_view` is now called `enable_view`\r\n- The syntax for defining a concept has changed slightly.

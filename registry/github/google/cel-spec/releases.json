v0.7.0 marks an important milestone for CEL as it introduces heterogeneous equality\r\nat runtime. The spec also documents a uniform definition of protobuf equality, and support\r\nfor cross-type numeric comparison to assist with evaluation over JSON data.\r\n\r\n## Spec Changes\r\n\r\nThe spec introduces heterogeneous equality to ensure that the following expressions\r\nagree with the type-checker behavior and match user expectations. The following\r\nexamples are expressions which might have errors at runtime, but will now return\r\nsuccessfully:\r\n\r\n```\r\njson.number < 1\r\njson.number == 2u\r\njson.struct['key'] != null\r\njson.number in [1, 2, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details on the changes in semantics, see the spec updates in #232.  \r\nTypically, this change will not result in a breaking behavior as it shifts errors to\r\nnon-errors; however, some users may be relying on these errors and find the\r\nnon-error result requires a change in how CEL is used within their application.\r\n\r\n* Document the duration string format supported by core implementations [#200]\r\n* Update the spec to support trailing commas in list, map, and struct literals [#202]\r\n* CEL Spec update to document heterogeneous equality, NaN, and ordering [#232]\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n* Additional tests for overflow and documentation of overflow conditions [#201]\r\n* Update the `get_milliseconds` test to match the spec [#206]\r\n* Heterogeneous null conformance tests [#218]\r\n* Add tests to list and map for heterogeneous null comparisons [#219]\r\n* Add tests for heterogenous numeric comparison [#220]\r\n* Add conformance tests for message equality [#223]\r\n* Numeric in/equality tests across numeric types [#230]\r\n* Edge case tests for cross-type numeric comparisons [#231]\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix double to int min case.

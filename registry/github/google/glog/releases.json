We did our best to ensure such compatibility in this version as well. However, downstream clients must recompile against the new glog version due to **ABI incompatible** changes.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nA number of functions, methods, and types have been deprecated in favor of more uniform interface.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\nDeprecated methods will be **removed** in glog 0.8.0. Please make sure to update your code.\r\n\r\n* `google::LogMessage::getMessageTime` has been superseded by `google::LogMessage::time`.\r\n* `google::LogMessageTime::timestamp` has been superseded by  `google::LogMessageTime::when`.\r\n* `google::LogMessageTime::gmtoff` has been superseded by `google::LogMessageTime::gmtoffset`.\r\n* `google::EnableLogCleaner(unsigned)` has been superseded by `google::EnableLogCleaner(std::chrono::minutes)`.\r\n* `google::LogSink::send` accepting `std::tm` (deprecated since glog 0.6.0) has been superseded by `google::LogSink::send` to accept `google::LogMessageTime` instead.\r\n* `google::LogMessageInfo` and the custom prefix callback accepting this type have been superseded by `google::LogMessage`. To customize the log line prefix use the `google::InstallPrefixFormatter` function instead of the `google::InitGoogleLogging` overload.\r\n\r\n## Further changes\r\n\r\n* `google::LogSeverity` has been converted to an unscoped `enum`. This can result in compilation issues if implicit conversion between an `int` and `google::LogSeverity` was erroneously assumed.\r\n* By default, CMake no longer generates the undocumented and untested pkg-config files.

However, downstream clients must recompile against the new glog version due to **ABI incompatible** changes.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nA number of functions, methods, and types have been deprecated in favor of more uniform interface.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\nDeprecated methods will be **removed** in glog 0.8.0. Please make sure to update your code.\r\n\r\n* `google::LogMessage::getMessageTime` has been superseded by `google::LogMessage::time`.\r\n* `google::LogMessageTime::timestamp` has been superseded by  `google::LogMessageTime::when`.\r\n* `google::LogMessageTime::gmtoff` has been superseded by `google::LogMessageTime::gmtoffset`.\r\n* `google::EnableLogCleaner(unsigned)` has been superseded by `google::EnableLogCleaner(std::chrono::minutes)`.\r\n* `google::LogSink::send` accepting `std::tm` (deprecated since glog 0.6.0) has been superseded by `google::LogSink::send` to accept `google::LogMessageTime` instead.\r\n* `google::LogMessageInfo` and the custom prefix callback accepting this type have been superseded by `google::LogMessage`. To customize the log line prefix use the `google::InstallPrefixFormatter` function instead of the `google::InitGoogleLogging` overload.\r\n\r\n## Further changes\r\n\r\n* `google::LogSeverity` has been converted to an unscoped `enum`. This can result in compilation issues if implicit conversion between an `int` and `google::LogSeverity` was erroneously assumed.\r\n* By default, CMake no longer generates the undocumented and untested pkg-config files. The support is now opt in which requires the CMake option `WITH_PKGCONFIG` to be explicitly set to `ON`.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* bazel: Use glog 0.6.0 in README. by @xiaoxq in

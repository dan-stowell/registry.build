Plot Item Flags\r\n\r\nEach of ImPlot's `PlotX` functions now takes an optional `ImPlotXFlags` parameter. This decision (1) allows us to easily add more options for plot items  and (2) allows us to consolidate and clean up some of the API. Here's what this looks like for `PlotLine`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Flags for ANY PlotX function\r\nenum ImPlotItemFlags_ {\r\n    ImPlotItemFlags_None     = 0,\r\n    ImPlotItemFlags_NoLegend = 1 << 0, // the item won't have a legend entry displayed\r\n    ImPlotItemFlags_NoFit    = 1 << 1, // the item won't be considered for plot fits\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Flags for PlotLine\r\nenum ImPlotLineFlags_ {\r\n    ImPlotLineFlags_None        = 0,       // default\r\n    ImPlotLineFlags_Segments    = 1 << 10, // a line segment will be rendered from every two consecutive points\r\n    ImPlotLineFlags_Loop        = 1 << 11, // the last and first point will be connected to form a closed loop\r\n    ImPlotLineFlags_SkipNaN     = 1 << 12, // NaNs values will be skipped instead of rendered as missing data\r\n    ImPlotLineFlags_NoClip      = 1 << 13, // markers (if displayed) on the edge of a plot will not be clipped\r\n};\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nvoid PlotLine(const char* label_id, const T* xs, const T* ys, int count, ImPlotLineFlags flags=0, int offset=0, int stride=sizeof(T));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, `PlotLine` has some new bells and whistles that are enabled with the `ImPlotLineFlags_` parameter, like rendering lines as segments or as a closed loop. Several other plotters have also gained new abilities through their respective flags (see the full list below). The special flags in `ImPlotItemFlags` can be combined with ANY `ImPlotXFlags`, e.g. `ImPlotItemFlags_NoLegend|ImPlotLineFlags_Segments` is valid code.\r\n\r\nHere's a complete list of flags available for our current plotters:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nImPlotItemFlags_NoLegend         // the item won't have a legend entry displayed\r\nImPlotItemFlags_NoFit            // the item won't be considered for plot fits\r\n\r\nImPlotLineFlags_Segments         // a line segment will be rendered from every two consecutive points\r\nImPlotLineFlags_Loop             // the last and first point will be connected to form a closed loop\r\nImPlotLineFlags_SkipNaN          // NaNs values will be skipped instead of rendered as missing data\r\nImPlotLineFlags_NoClip           // markers (if displayed) on the edge of a plot will not be clipped\r\n\r\nImPlotScatterFlags_NoClip        // markers on the edge of a plot will not be clipped\r\n\r\nImPlotStairsFlags_PreStep        // the y value is continued constantly to the left from every x position, i.e. the interval (x[i-1], x[i]] has the value y[i]\r\n\r\nImPlotBarsFlags_Horizontal       // bars will be rendered horizontally on the current y-axis\r\n\r\nImPlotBarGroupsFlags_Horizontal  // bar groups will be rendered horizontally on the current y-axis\r\nImPlotBarGroupsFlags_Stacked     // items in a group will be stacked on top of each other\r\n\r\nImPlotErrorBarsFlags_Horizontal  // error bars will be rendered horizontally on the current y-axis\r\n\r\nImPlotStemsFlags_Horizontal      // stems will be rendered horizontally on the current y-axis\r\n\r\nImPlotInfLinesFlags_Horizontal   // lines will be rendered horizontally on the current y-axis\r\n\r\nImPlotPieChartFlags_Normalize    // force normalization of pie chart values (i.e. always make a full circle if sum < 0)\r\n\r\nImPlotHeatmapFlags_ColMajor      // data will be read in column major order\r\n\r\nImPlotHistogramFlags_Horizontal  // histogram bars will be rendered horizontally (not supported by PlotHistogram2D)\r\nImPlotHistogramFlags_Cumulative  // each bin will contain its count plus the counts of all previous bins (not supported by PlotHistogram2D)\r\nImPlotHistogramFlags_Density     // counts will be normalized, i.e. the PDF will be visualized, or the CDF will be visualized if Cumulative is also set\r\nImPlotHistogramFlags_NoOutliers  // exclude values outside the specifed histogram range from the count toward normalizing and cumulative counts\r\nImPlotHistogramFlags_ColMajor    // data will be read in column major order (not supported by PlotHistogram)\r\n\r\nImPlotTextFlags_Vertical         // text will be rendered vertically\r\n```\r\n\r\n **SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE**: Each `PlotX` function's `ImPlotLineFlags flags=0` parameter has been positioned before `int offset=0, int stride=sizeof(T)` where applicable. This unfortunately means that folks making use of offset and/or stride will need to update their function calls to include a flags parameter, else they will likely see strange results or crashes without any warning. This may rub some users the wrong way, but it was a necessary evil as it stylistically makes the most sense for the flags parameter to take priority over stride and offset in the default argument order for most use cases and users. \r\n\r\nBesides that, items flags brings about a few other **API breaking changes** users should be aware of:\r\n\r\n- `PlotBarsH` has been removed; use `PlotBars` + `ImPlotBarsFlags_Horizontal` instead\r\n- `PlotErrorBarsH` has been removed; use `PlotErrorBars` + `ImPlotErrorBarsFlags_Horizontal`\r\n- `PlotVLines` and `PlotHLines` replaced with `PlotInfLines` (+ `ImPlotInfLinesFlags_Horizontal` )\r\n- `PlotHistogram`/`PlotHistogram2D` signatures changed; `cumulative`, `density`, and `outliers` options now specified via `ImPlotHistogramFlags`\r\n- `PlotPieChart` signature changed; `normalize` option now specified via `ImPlotPieChartFlags`\r\n- `PlotText` signature changes; `vertical` option now specified via `ImPlotTextFlags_Vertical`\r\n\r\nAgain, this change will likely cause headaches for some users, but with this new system in place you can expect more plotting options to be added in future updates in a flexible and, importantly, maintainable way. Thanks for understanding. \r\n\r\n### SetupAxisScale\r\n\r\nPreviously, users could define time and log scales with `ImPlotAxisFlags_Log`, and `ImPlotAxisFlags_Time`. These flags have been replaced with a more general system using a new the setup function `SetupAxisScale`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n\r\n// Axis scale\r\nenum ImPlotScale_ {\r\n    ImPlotScale_Linear = 0, // default linear scale\r\n    ImPlotScale_Time,       // date/time scale\r\n    ImPlotScale_Log10,      // base 10 logartithmic scale\r\n    ImPlotScale_SymLog,     // symmetric log scale\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Sets an axis' scale using built-in options.\r\nvoid SetupAxisScale(ImAxis axis, ImPlotScale scale);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ImPlotScale_SymLog` is a new scale that produces a symmertic log scale with a linear region roughly between -1 and 1:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/174466208-f7caf2f6-fa7e-448a-aa46-56a7280f0d3b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMore built-in scales may be added in the future. Until then, you can also now define **YOUR OWN** scales using `ImPlotTransform` to provide a forward and inverse function:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Callback signature for axis transform.\r\ntypedef double (*ImPlotTransform)(double value, void* user_data);\r\n\r\n// Sets an axis' scale using user supplied forward and inverse transfroms.\r\nvoid SetupAxisScale(ImAxis axis, ImPlotTransform forward, ImPlotTransform inverse, void* data=NULL);\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic inline double TransformForward_Sqrt(double v, void*) {\r\n    return sqrt(v);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic inline double TransformInverse_Sqrt(double v, void*) {\r\n    return v*v;\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nif (ImPlot::BeginPlot(\"Sqrt\")) {\r\n    ImPlot::SetupAxis(ImAxis_X1, \"Linear\");\r\n    ImPlot::SetupAxis(ImAxis_Y1, \"Sqrt\");\r\n    ImPlot::SetupAxisScale(ImAxis_Y1, TransformForward_Sqrt, TransformInverse_Sqrt);\r\n    ImPlot::PlotLine(...);\r\n    ImPlot::EndPlot();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/174464981-e4e1afbd-b81e-4ad3-82a9-ffb3a7f8e3dd.png)\r\n\r\n### New Axis Constraints\r\n\r\nYou can now constrain axes limits so that users can't pan beyond a min or max value, or zoom beyond a min or max width/height. This is nice if you don't want users straying away from displayed data or zooming too far into view. It is demonstrated in the candlestick demo in `implot_demo.cpp` (see Custom Plotters and Tooltips).\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Sets an axis' limits constraints.\r\nvoid SetupAxisLimitsConstraints(ImAxis axis, double v_min, double v_max);\r\n// Sets an axis' zoom constraints.\r\nvoid SetupAxisZoomConstraints(ImAxis axis, double z_min, double z_max);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Customize Supported Types\r\n\r\nYou can now customize the supported types by defining `IMPLOT_CUSTOM_NUMERIC_TYPES` at compile time to define your own type list. As an example, you could use the compile time define given by the line below in order to support only float and double.\r\n```\r\n-DIMPLOT_CUSTOM_NUMERIC_TYPES=\"(float)(double)\"\r\n```\r\nIn order to support all known C++ types, use:\r\n```\r\n-DIMPLOT_CUSTOM_NUMERIC_TYPES=\"(signed char)(unsigned char)(signed short)(unsigned short)(signed int)(unsigned int)(signed long)(unsigned long)(signed long long)(unsigned long long)(float)(double)(long double)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @pthom for inplementing this feature (#397) and greatly simplifying our plotter insantiation pipeline with some mean macro magic!\r\n\r\n### Continuous Integration\r\n\r\nThe ImPlot repository now provides CI through GitHub Actions. The jobs are setup to build ImPlot and a headless example application against the latest ImGui version across several compilers and platforms. Jobs are triggered for all new PRs. \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @rokups for setting this up (#395), @ozlb for the initial push (#393), @pthom for further improvements (#397), and @ocornut for his thoughtful comments.\r\n\r\n### Misc. Improvements\r\n\r\n- Line plots now honor ImGui's `AntiAliasedLines` and `AntiAliasedLinesUseTex`. That's right, ImPlot now uses texture based AA! If you weren't using MSAA, you can now expect signficantly smoother lines for very little performance cost.\r\n- Markers and bar plots now render through ImPlot's custom render pipeline instead of ImGui's drawing API. This should speed up those plotters a good bit. \r\n- Compile times for `implot_items.cpp` should now be much quicker now. \r\n- Legend entries can be sorted using `ImPlotLegendFlags_Sort`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/77461993/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":8,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":4},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/58306730","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/58306730/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/58306730/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/epezent/implot/releases/tag/v0.13","id":58306730,"author":{"login":"epezent","id":29577475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc3NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29577475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent","html_url":"https://github.com/epezent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOD1qcIc4DebCq","tag_name":"v0.13","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.13 WIP","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2022-01-31T01:07:12Z","updated_at":"2022-01-31T06:13:55Z","published_at":"2022-01-31T06:13:55Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/tarball/v0.13","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/zipball/v0.13","body":"### Setup API (see #272)\r\n\r\nPreviously, setting up a plot and its axes was done by passing several args to `BeginPlot` and leveraging a handful of preceding `SetNextXXX` functions. The former was becoming unwieldy with `BeginPlot` requiring additional args for each newly introduced feature, while the latter was always awkward and a bit of a nightmare to manage under the hood. Neither approach offered room to scale the API gracefully. \r\n\r\nTaking a page out of ImGui's `Tables` API, plots and axes can now be configured by calling a host of **optional**  `SetupXXX` functions immediately after `BeginPlot`. With this, the signature of `BeginPlot` has be greatly simplified. Here's a quick example:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nif (BeginPlot(\"My Plot\",ImVec2(-1,-1),ImPlotFlags_Crosshairs) { // 1) begin a new plot\r\n  SetupAxis(ImAxis_X1, \"Time\", ImPlotAxisFlags_Time);           // 2) make Setup calls\r\n  SetupAxis(ImAxis_Y1, \"My Y-Axis\");\r\n  SetupAxisLimits(ImAxis_Y1, 0, 1000);\r\n  SetupAxisFormat(ImAxis_Y1, \"$%.0f\");\r\n  SetupLegend(ImPlotLocation_North);\r\n  ...\r\n  SetupFinish();                                                // 3) [optional] explicitly finish setup\r\n  PlotLine(...);                                                // 4) plot items\r\n  ...\r\n  EndPlot();                                                    // 5) end the plot\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of the functionality you previously had with the original signature of `BeginPlot` and `SetNextXXX` is now available through the Setup API:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Begin a new plot. \r\nbool BeginPlot(const char* title_id, const ImVec2& size = ImVec2(-1,0), ImPlotFlags flags = ImPlotFlags_None);\r\n```\r\n```cpp\r\n// Enables an axis or sets the label and/or flags for an existing axis.

Once you call this, you cannot make anymore Setup calls for the current plot!\r\n// Note that calling this function is OPTIONAL; it will be called by the first subsequent setup-locking API call.\r\nvoid SetupFinish();\r\n```\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n- Always call Setup code at the top of your `BeginPlot` conditional statement.\r\n- Setup is locked once you start plotting or explicitly call `SetupFinish`. Do NOT call Setup code after you begin plotting or after you make any non-Setup API calls (e.g. utils like `PlotToPixels` also lock Setup)\r\n- Calling `SetupFinish` is **OPTIONAL**, but probably good practice. If you do not all it yourself, then the first subsequent plotting or utility function will call it for you.\r\n- The primary X and Y axis (`ImAxis_X1` and `ImAxis_Y1`) are always enabled. To enable auxiliary axes, you must call, e.g. `SetupAxis(ImAxis_Y2,...)`. This replaces the existing method of enabling auxiliary axes, i.e. passing `ImPlotFlags_YAxis2/3`.\r\n- Some `SetNextXXX` API has been removed or renamed; check the top of `implot.cpp` for changelogs\r\n- **The original `BeginPlot` signature has been deprecated, and usage will result in compiler warnings. Please begin transitioning your code before its removal v1.0! You can define `IMPLOT_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS` to remove it now.**\r\n\r\n### New Axes Features\r\n\r\nThe new Setup API allows us to easily extend and add functionality to axes. Here are a few new features you can start using today, with more expected to come in the near future.\r\n\r\n- support for multiple x-axes (up to 3 x-axes, and 3 y-axes)\r\n  - `ImAxis_` enums replace `ImPlotYAxis_`\r\n  - `SetAxis` replaces `SetPlotYAxis`\r\n- place axes on opposite side with `ImPlotAxisFlags_Opposite` or simply by dragging the axis to the other side\r\n- new style colors: `ImPlotCol_AxisBgHovered` and `ImPlotCol_AxisBgActive`\r\n- when multiple x or y axes are enabled, hovering an item legend icon highlights the axes it is plotted on\r\n- axes use `ImGui::ButtonBehavior` under the hood for more robust interaction\r\n\r\n![axes2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/137951482-6c708f9e-59a5-4e37-9533-31d59d0d75c9.gif)\r\n\r\n- custom tick label formatting via `ImPlotFormatter` callbacks passed to `SetupAxisFormat`\r\n- formatting is applied to mouse position text\r\n- context menus now display axis label name, if available\r\n\r\n![fmt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/137953519-d46cef58-68c4-4251-bec4-464d52be105a.gif)\r\n\r\n### Improved Tooling\r\n\r\n- `Query` has been removed and replaced with a more flexible tool, `DragRect`. Unlike the previous query system, these can be resized and multiple can exist in one plot. An example in the demo shows how you can convert plot selections in to new query rects.\r\n\r\n![dragect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/137954112-4cc9d490-f7c4-4a01-9753-55a9b113462a.gif)\r\n![dragect2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/137954135-1c82bcc8-ef4a-42e0-94fa-749eb02bad06.gif)\r\n\r\n- `TagX` and `TagY` have been added and allow you to add custom labels to axes. These use either the axis' formatter, or a custom provided string. You can combine these with other tools like `DragLine` to create custom interactivity.\r\n\r\n![tags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/137954599-9075c054-8a68-480b-ba7f-fd2b5cb05b36.gif)\r\n\r\n- `DragPoint` and `DragLine` no longer take a string ID. Instead they now expect an `int` ID, and as a result no longer display the optional label. Instead, use `TagX/Y` and `Annotation` to add labels too these tools if needed.\r\n- additional options for drag tools via `ImPlotDragToolFlags`\r\n\r\n### PlotBarGroups\r\n\r\n- Bar plots can now be plotted in groups.\r\n- Bar groups can be stacked\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Flags for ImPlot::PlotBarGroups\r\nenum ImPlotBarGroupsFlags_ {\r\n    ImPlotBarGroupsFlags_None     = 0,      // default\r\n    ImPlotBarGroupsFlags_Stacked  = 1 << 0, // items in a group will be stacked on top of each other\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Plots a group of vertical bars. #values is a row-major matrix with #item_count rows and #group_count cols. #label_ids should have #item_count elements.\r\nvoid PlotBarGroups(const char* const label_ids[], const T* values, int item_count, int group_count, double group_width=0.67, double x0=0, ImPlotBarGroupsFlags flags=ImPlotBarGroupsFlags_None);\r\n\r\n// Plots a group of horizontal bars. #values is a row-major matrix with #item_count rows and #group_count cols. #label_ids should have #item_count elements.\r\nvoid PlotBarGroupsH(const char* const label_ids[], const T* values, int item_count, int group_count, double group_height=0.67, double y0=0, ImPlotBarGroupsFlags flags=ImPlotBarGroupsFlags_None);\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/151712784-27329017-b885-4574-826d-f3f8699f73c5.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29577475/151712800-a996e08f-0305-4a2a-9249-d5186d3dfb6d.png)\r\n\r\n### Return of ImPlotInputMap\r\n\r\n- `ImPlotInputMap` has been revamped and brought back into the public API, and two presets are now provided: `Default` and `Reverse`\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct ImPlotInputMap {\r\n    ImGuiMouseButton Pan;           // LMB    enables panning when held,\r\n    ImGuiKeyModFlags PanMod;        // none   optional modifier that must be held for panning/fitting\r\n    ImGuiMouseButton Fit;           // LMB    initiates fit when double clicked\r\n    ImGuiMouseButton Select;        // RMB    begins box selection when pressed and confirms selection when released\r\n    ImGuiMouseButton SelectCancel;  // LMB    cancels active box selection when pressed; cannot be same as Select\r\n    ImGuiKeyModFlags SelectMod;     // none   optional modifier that must be held for box selection\r\n    ImGuiKeyModFlags SelectHorzMod; // Alt    expands active box selection horizontally to plot edge when held\r\n    ImGuiKeyModFlags SelectVertMod; // Shift  expands active box selection vertically to plot edge when held\r\n    ImGuiMouseButton Menu;          // RMB    opens context menus (if enabled) when clicked\r\n    ImGuiKeyModFlags OverrideMod;   // Ctrl   when held, all input is ignored; used to enable axis/plots as DND sources\r\n    ImGuiKeyModFlags ZoomMod;       // none   optional modifier that must be held for scroll wheel zooming\r\n    float            ZoomRate;      // 0.1f   zoom rate for scroll (e.g. 0.1f = 10% plot range every scroll click); make negative to invert\r\n    ImPlotInputMap();\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Provides access to input mapping structure for permanent modifications to controls for pan, select, etc.\r\nImPlotInputMap& GetInputMap();\r\n\r\n// Default input mapping: pan = LMB drag, box select = RMB drag, fit = LMB double click, context menu = RMB click, zoom = scroll.\r\nvoid MapInputDefault(ImPlotInputMap* dst = NULL);\r\n// Reverse input mapping: pan = RMB drag, box select = LMB drag, fit = LMB double click, context menu = RMB click, zoom = scroll.\r\nvoid MapInputReverse(ImPlotInputMap* dst = NULL);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes / Improvementss\r\n\r\n- fix Intel compiler warnings (#315)\r\n- replace `sprintf/snprintf` calls with `ImFormatString` for overridability (#310)\r\n- fix issues with striding when T != float (#303)\r\n- handle `format-nonliteral` warnings (#304)\r\n- fix issue with unitialized variables (#313)\r\n- make `PlotText` fitable (#286)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/58306730/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/51638239","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/51638239/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/51638239/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/epezent/implot/releases/tag/v0.12","id":51638239,"author":{"login":"epezent","id":29577475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc3NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29577475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent","html_url":"https://github.com/epezent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOD1qcIc4DE-_f","tag_name":"v0.12","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.12 WIP","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2021-09-08T04:46:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-19T16:52:48Z","published_at":"2021-10-19T16:52:48Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/tarball/v0.12","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/zipball/v0.12","body":"Represents a stable release before API breaking changes to be introduced in v0.13."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/45995896","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/45995896/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/releases/45995896/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/epezent/implot/releases/tag/v0.11","id":45995896,"author":{"login":"epezent","id":29577475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc3NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29577475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent","html_url":"https://github.com/epezent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epezent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQ1OTk1ODk2","tag_name":"v0.11","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.11 WIP","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2021-07-10T00:39:12Z","updated_at":"2021-07-10T03:30:35Z","published_at":"2021-07-10T03:30:21Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/tarball/v0.11","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epezent/implot/zipball/v0.11","body":"Merely fixes a bug released in v0.10 that caused incompatibility with pre-v1.84 ImGui.

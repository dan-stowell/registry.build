Ours is currently only a serial CPU implementation, so performance isn't spectacular, but we aim to offer the GPU implementation in due course. To run PDLP, choose the option solver=pdlp. Note that there is currently no time-out available for PDLP, and the termination criteria for cuPDLP-c may mean that the HiGHS optimality conditions are not satisfied. See [README.md](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/tree/master/src/pdlp/cupdlp/README.md) .\r\n\r\nThe HiGHS interior point solver now allows analytic centre calculations to be performed. This is done by setting the HiGHS option run_centring to be true. Other new options allow the centring calculations to be controlled.\r\n\r\nWhen Highs::run() is called, ranges of the matrix, costs, bounds and RHS are reported, together with advice on setting the new HiGHS options user_cost_scale and used_bound_scale if there are extreme values.\r\n\r\nAfter solving an LP, the method Highs::getIllConditioning tries (in an approach similar to that used by Gurobi) to identify constraints or basic variables that contribute most to ill-conditioning of the basis matrix.\r\n\r\nLogging from the interior point solver is now consistent with logging from the simplex and MIP solvers.\r\n\r\nThe Python interface has been updated, with several overlooked methods having been added\r\n\r\nConsiderable modifications and fixes have been added to the build system, in particular for Python. highspy is no longer built with meson, rather a combination of setuptools and cmake.\r\n\r\nBugs in the QP and MIP solvers have been fixed\r\n\r\nThanks are due to due to @fwesselm @feldmeier and @Coloquinte","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/145189166/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":20,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":3},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/123066411","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/123066411/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/123066411/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases/tag/v1.6.0","id":123066411,"author":{"login":"galabovaa","id":4016566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTY1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4016566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa","html_url":"https://github.com/galabovaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galabovaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOB5HJRs4HVdgr","tag_name":"v1.6.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.6.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2023-09-28T14:59:04Z","published_at":"2023-09-29T05:31:06Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/tarball/v1.6.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/zipball/v1.6.0","body":"Added [logging, improving solution and interrupt callbacks](https://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/stable/callbacks/) to C++ and C for a single user-defined callback method.

have been made to improve the reliability of the IPM solver when cross-over is not always run - carried out for benchmarking purposes. This has required the `run_crossover` option that was previously Boolean to become a string with possible values \"on\", \"off\" and \"choose\". The latter results in crossover being run if the result of IPM without crossover is imprecise.\r\n\r\nHiGHS will now allow a solution to be read from a file when running HiGHS from the command line, and handle the case where a user has supplied a partial (discrete) solution to a MIP. If the supplied solution is not feasible, HiGHS will fix the discrete variables and attempt to find a feasible assignment of the continuous variables by solving an LP.\r\n\r\nIf the incumbent model has discrete variables, then the MIP is solved regardless of the setting of the `solve` option. Previously if `solve` were \"simplex\" or \"ipm\" then the relaxation would be solved. To force the relaxation to be solved, set the (new) `solve_relaxation` option (default \"false\") to be true.\r\n\r\nVarious bug fixes, notably time limit introduced into redundant equations rule for

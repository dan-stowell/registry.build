Instead of naively storing individual CSV fields as singular `std::string`s in a `std::vector`, the parser keeps references to the raw input and uses lightweight `RawCSVField` objects to mark where a specific field starts and ends in that field (as well as flag indicating if an escaped quote is present). This has the benefits of:\r\n\r\n1. Avoiding the cost of constructing many `std::string` instances\r\n2. Avoiding the cost of constant `std::vector` reallocations\r\n3. Preserving locality of reference\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the CSV Parser also uses separate threads for parsing CSV and for iterating over the data. As CSV rows are parsed, they are made available to the user who may utilize them without interrupting the parsing of new rows.\r\n\r\n#### The Race Condition\r\nThe `RawCSVField` objects mentioned previously were stored as contiguous blocks, and an `std::vector` of pointers to these blocks were used to keep track of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, as @ludovicdelfau accurately diagnosed, if the reading thread attempted to access a `RawCSVField` (e.g. through reading a `CSVField` ) at the same time that a parsing thread was pushing a new `RawCSVField` to an at-capacity `std::vector`, the parsing thread's push would cause the contents of the `std::vector` to be reallocated, thus causing the reading thread to access deallocated memory.\r\n\r\nThis issue was first reported in #217.\r\n\r\n#### The Fix\r\nThe fix was simple. An `std::deque` was dropped in to replace `std::vector` to store `RawCSVField` pointers, as `std::deque` does not perform reallocations. This change appears to even **improve the CSV Parser's performance** as the cost of constant reallocations is avoided. The loss of memory locality typical in `std::deque` applications was avoided as, again, the CSV Parser is storing pointers to `RawCSVField[]` and not the `RawCSVField` objects themselves.\r\n\r\n##

`DelimWriter` automatically converts numbers and other data types stored in vectors, arrays, and tuples\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* `CSVReader` is now a no-copy parser when memory-mapped IO is used\r\n  * `CSVRow` and `CSVField` now refer to the original memory map\r\n* Significant performance improvements for some files\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed potential thread safety issues with

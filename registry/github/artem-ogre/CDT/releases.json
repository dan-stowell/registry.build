is a major release containing new features.\r\n### Performance Improvements\r\n- Vertex insertion order is now randomized by default. This results in better performance overall and avoids many worst-case situations.\r\n- Boost's RTree is replaced with a custom kd-tree implementation included into CDT sources.\r\nIt outperforms boost::rtree and has a significantly smaller memory footprint. \r\n- Boost RTree and nearest-random point locators are removed.\r\n- Index types used by CDT are changed to 32-bit to reduce required memory. 64-bit indices can be enabled with `CDT_USE_64_BIT_INDEX_TYPE`.\r\n\r\nAlso see: Issue: #40 Pull-request: #45 \r\n\r\n### Boost dependency is not necessary\r\nAs `boost::rtree` is replaced with custom kd-tree implementation, boost is mostly needed for c++98 compatibility and not for performance.\r\nThis means that most of the users will not need to enable boost.\r\n\r\n### Overlapping boundaries support\r\nEnables handling overlaping boundaries in hole-removal algorithm.\r\nHere is an example:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7488293/138878945-46ae2ed8-7c30-4d0a-94ba-4ff01b3d86d2.png\" alt=\"Sweden\" height=\"200\"/>\r\n\r\nAlgorithm tracks edges that were constrained more than once in `insertEdges`.\r\nNew `PeelLayer` and `CalculateTriangleDepth` functions handle overlapping boundaries.\r\nPeel layer can now return seeds for next layer **and** deeper layers (due to overlapping boundaries).\r\n\r\nAlso see: Issue: #42  Pull-request: #43\r\n\r\n### Other changes/fixes\r\n- README and doxygen docs are updated\r\n- #34 Do not allow flipping a fixed edge #44 \r\n- Some fixes for broken c++98 compatibility\r\n- Fixes in verifyTopology and InitializeWithGrid: #47 #48 \r\n- More fixes after 1.1.1: #51

Overview \r\nBug-fix release: fix an error in code that tests if an edge flip is required.\r\nIssue: #37 \r\nFixing PR: #38 \r\n\r\n#### Fix Details\r\nPreviously flip was rejected only if both vertices of flip-candidate edge belong to the super-triangle.\r\nThis sometimes resulted in wrong edges and incorrect convex-hull.\r\nThe change: instead reject the edge-flip if \r\n- at least one flip-candidate edge's vertex belongs to super-triangle\r\n- original edge does not touch super-triangle.\r\n\r\nIf the case when both original edge and flip-candidate edge touch super-triangle use normal circumcircle test as a tie-breaker.\r\n\r\nTwo test files for regression testing are added.\r\n\r\n","discussion_url":"https://github.com/artem-ogre/CDT/discussions/39"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/artem-ogre/CDT/releases/39951401","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/artem-ogre/CDT/releases/39951401/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/artem-ogre/CDT/releases/39951401/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/artem-ogre/CDT/releases/tag/1.0.0","id":39951401,"author":{"login":"artem-ogre","id":7488293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODgyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7488293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre","html_url":"https://github.com/artem-ogre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artem-ogre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM5OTUxNDAx","tag_name":"1.0.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"[v1.0.0]

This alpha release incorporates over 2k commits since GTSAM 4.2.\r\n\r\n**Key Highlights:**\r\n\r\n*   **C++17 Standard & Boost Removal:** GTSAM now requires C++17. A monumental effort has been made to remove Boost dependencies throughout the library, replacing them with C++17 standard library features or internal implementations. This was a large collaborative effort, with major contributions from @kartikarcot and @varunagrawal.\r\n*   **Hybrid Inference Overhaul:** Substantial enhancements to hybrid (discrete-continuous) inference capabilities, including new factors, improved elimination, and API refinements, primarily driven by @varunagrawal.\r\n*   **Discrete Factor & Inference Improvements:** Introduction of the `TableFactor` (by @ywkim0606) for sparse discrete factors, along with significant optimizations to `DecisionTreeFactor` and discrete elimination strategies (led by @varunagrawal).\r\n*   **Python Wrapper Enhancements:** The Python bindings have seen extensive updates, including the generation of type hint stub files (`.pyi`) for better IDE support and the adoption of `cibuildwheel` for building and distributing Python wheels (thanks to @varunagrawal, @ProfFan, @p-zach, @yambati03).\r\n*   **Eigen 3.4.0 Upgrade:** The core linear algebra library Eigen has been updated to version 3.4.0.\r\n*   **ISAM2 Fixes:** Important fixes related to ISAM2 marginalization and updates (by @gradyrw, @ProfFan, @varunagrawal).\r\n\r\n**Other Notable Changes:**\r\n\r\n*   **New Factors & Capabilities:** Including support for fisheye camera models (@kkelchte), BATA translation averaging for SfM (@akshay-krishnan), fundamental matrix factors, the Galilean3 Lie group (@mkielo3), and GPS factors with lever-arm correction (@mnissov), and making NavState into a fully fledged $SE_2(3)$.\r\n*   **Navigation & Filtering:** Significant improvements to AHRS, new (Invariant) EKF examples, and more accurate Lie group Jacobians (contributions from @andre-michelin, @mkielo3, @BrettRD).\r\n*   **Build System & CI:** Numerous modernizations to CMake, improved TBB handling, and more robust CI pipelines across platforms (many contributors including @varunagrawal, @jlblancoc, @talregev).\r\n*   **Documentation Revamp:** Migration to a new MyST-based documentation site with improved content and structure, plus automated docstring generation for Python (led by @p-zach).\r\n\r\nWe are excited for the community to try it out and surface issues to be fixed in new pre-releases soon, leading up to 4.3 main release!\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @gradyrw made their first contribution in https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/pull/1105\r\n* @ShuangLiu1992 made their first contribution in

is hopefully the last 4.2 pre-release. I had planned to cut 4.2 this weekend but there were still apparently some issues with the wrapper when used in Georgia tech's CS 3630 course (325 students using GTSAM) and so I'd rather wait another week for these things to settle down. In the meantime, though, we needed a pre-release so `%pip install gtbook` works on Google Colab and installs 4.2a9 in the process. All works now, as evidenced at [roboticsbook.org](https://www.roboticsbook.org/intro.html).\r\n\r\nThe **biggest** changes are:\r\n- moved away from boost utilities to **c++ initializers** in all tests and examples.\r\n- a cleaned up and correctly working **hybrid inference** framework. Thanks @varunagrawal and @ProfFan !\r\n- template-magical *NoiseModelFactorN* which allows an arbitrary number of variables connected to factors.

all,\r\n\r\nThis is the GTSAM 4.1 release!\r\n\r\n## Reason for This Release\r\n\r\nThis is originally the 4.1rc release candidate. We are releasing this as 4.1 because at the same date `4.1rc` was tagged, we release PyPI versions with this `4.1.0` version number. This was a mistake but we are now normalizing it.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n\r\n* New `pybind11` based Python wrapper\r\n  * No more `dynamic_cast_xxx`s, so operations on noise models and etc should be more intuitive\r\n  * Also allows the user to wrap their own projects with our `wrap` submodule, details will come later\r\n  * It is also live on pypi, so install now with `pip3 install gtsam`!\r\n* Shonan Averaging is now in GTSAM!\r\n  * For usage, please refer to the website: https://dellaert.github.io/ShonanAveraging/index.html\r\n* MATLAB wrapper is now refreshed: Point2 and Point3 are removed and replaced by native MATLAB vectors.\r\n  * Thus, now you can build the MATLAB wrapper and the Python wrapper at the same time, so great news for packagers!\r\n* All goodies in 4.0.3 are also included :) \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy testing this pre-release and report the issues you encounter to our bug tracker!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nThe GTSAM Team\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/borglab/gtsam/releases/30065251/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":3,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/borglab/gtsam/releases/28836109","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/borglab/gtsam/releases/28836109/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/borglab/gtsam/releases/28836109/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/releases/tag/4.0.3","id":28836109,"author":{"login":"ProfFan","id":5358374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTgzNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5358374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan","html_url":"https://github.com/ProfFan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ProfFan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI4ODM2MTA5","tag_name":"4.0.3","target_commitish":"release/4.0.3","name":"GTSAM 4.0.3 Release","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-07-22T16:22:57Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T16:40:17Z","published_at":"2020-07-22T16:40:17Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/borglab/gtsam/tarball/4.0.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/borglab/gtsam/zipball/4.0.3","body":"Here we present you the latest release of GTSAM, GTSAM `4.0.3`.\r\n\r\n**GTSAM will now default to using the full SE(3) exponential map, instead of using the Cayley map, which should give better convergence for most problems without performance impact.**\r\n\r\nFor details, please see the [blog post](https://gtsam.org/gtsam.org/2020/07/16/new-release-gtsam.html).\r\n\r\n## Important New Features & Bugfixes\r\n\r\nIn addition to the change in default Pose3 retract, which will now be the full exponential map, GTSAM has seen a steady stream of commits since the last release, 4.0.2, which has been there for more than 6 months.

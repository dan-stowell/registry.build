https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/pull/1\n* chore: address changes as a follow-up by @thesayyn in https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/pull/5\n* feat: support oci-layout output by @thesayyn in https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/pull/6\n* example: add multi arch & repo example by @thesayyn in https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/pull/8\n* feat: fail if initial setup has not been performed by @thesayyn in https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/pull/9\n* docs: add cache and rule docs by @thesayyn in https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/pull/10\n\n## New Contributors\n* @thesayyn made their first contribution in https://github.com/chainguard-dev/rules_apko/pull/1\n\n**Full Changelog**:

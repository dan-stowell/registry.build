Classification tasks are widely used in web applications and we believe giving access to the complete fastText API from the browser will notably help our community to build nice tools. See our [documentation](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/webassembly-module.html) to learn more.\r\n\r\nAutotune: automatic hyperparameter optimization\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nFinding the best hyperparameters is crucial for building efficient models. However, searching the best hyperparameters manually is difficult. This release includes the [autotune feature](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/fasttext-blog-post-open-source-in-brief/) that allows you to find automatically the best hyperparameters for your dataset.\r\nYou can find more information on how to use it [here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/autotune.html).\r\n\r\nPython\r\n--------\r\nfastText loves Python. In this release, we have:\r\n- several bug fixes for prediction functions\r\n- nearest neighbors and analogies for Python\r\n- a memory leak fix\r\n- website tutorials with Python examples\r\n\r\nThe autotune feature is fully integrated with our Python API. This allows us to have a more stable autotune optimization loop from Python and to synchronize the best hyper-parameters with the `_FastText` model object.\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-trained models tool\r\n--------------------------\r\nWe release two helper scripts:\r\n- [download_model.py](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html#download-directly-with-command-line-or-from-python) to automatically download pre-trained vectors from our website\r\n- [reduce_model.py](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html#adapt-the-dimension) to reduce the word-vectors' size using PCA.\r\n\r\nThey can also be used directly from our Python API.\r\n\r\nMore metrics\r\n---------------\r\nWhen you test a trained model, you can now have more detailed results for the precision/recall metrics of a specific label or all labels.\r\n\r\nPaper source code\r\n------------------\r\nThis release contains the source code of the [unsupervised multilingual alignment paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11222).\r\n\r\nCommunity feedback and contributions\r\n--------------------------------\r\nWe want to thank our community for giving us feedback on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1174547215919768/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText).\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/25955458/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":15,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/18412792","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/18412792/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/18412792/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/tag/v0.9.1","id":18412792,"author":{"login":"Celebio","id":241347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/241347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio","html_url":"https://github.com/Celebio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE4NDEyNzky","tag_name":"v0.9.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.9.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2019-07-04T11:48:15Z","published_at":"2019-07-04T11:53:06Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/tarball/v0.9.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/zipball/v0.9.1","body":"We are happy to announce the release of version 0.9.1.\r\n\r\nNew release of python module\r\n----------\r\nThe main goal of this release is to merge two existing python modules: the official `fastText` module which was available on our github repository and the unofficial `fasttext` module which was available on pypi.org.\r\n\r\nYou can find an overview of the new API [here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/python-module.html), and more insight in our [blog post](https://fasttext.cc/blog/2019/06/25/blog-post.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRefactoring\r\n-----\r\nThis version includes a massive rewrite of internal classes. The training and test are now split into three different classes : `Model` that takes care of the computational aspect, `Loss` that handles loss and applies gradients to the output matrix, and `State` that is responsible of holding the model's state inside each thread.\r\n\r\nThat makes the code more straighforward to read but also gives a smaller memory footprint, because the data needed for loss computation is now hold only once unlike before where there was one for each thread.\r\n\r\nMisc\r\n--------\r\n- Compilation issues fix for recent versions of Mac OS X.\r\n- Better unicode handling :\r\n    - [`on_unicode_error` argument](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/commit/e13484bcb261cda51d33c4940ab5e207aba3ee79) that helps to handle unicode issues one can face with some datasets\r\n   - [bug fix](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/commit/71c0ee5a8b91df21585aec8cb18991d696414fd5) related to different behaviour of pybind11's `py::str` class between python2 and python3\r\n- script for [unsupervised alignment](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/commit/29c728ff4f05740be34a580ced3a065f57f8d10b)\r\n- public file hosting changed from `aws` to `fbaipublicfiles`\r\n- we added a Code of Conduct file.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you !\r\n------------------\r\nAs always, we want to thank you for your help and your precious feedback which helps making this project better."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/14610055","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/14610055/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/14610055/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/releases/tag/v0.2.0","id":14610055,"author":{"login":"Celebio","id":241347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/241347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio","html_url":"https://github.com/Celebio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celebio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE0NjEwMDU1","tag_name":"v0.2.0","target_commitish":"7842495a4d64c7a3bb4339d45d6e64321d002ed8","name":"0.2.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2018-12-18T03:11:13Z","published_at":"2018-12-19T14:58:16Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/tarball/v0.2.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebookresearch/fastText/zipball/v0.2.0","body":"We are happy to announce the change of the license from BSD+patents to MIT and the release of fastText 0.2.0.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this release is to set a beta C++ API of the `FastText` class. The class now behaves as a computational library: we moved the display and some usage error handlings outside of it (mainly to `main.cc` and `fasttext_pybind.cc`). It is still compatible with older versions of the class, but some methods are now marked as deprecated and will probably be removed in the next release.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, we also introduce the official support for python. The [python binding of fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/tree/master/python) is a client of the `FastText` class.\r\n\r\nHere is a short summary of the [104 commits](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/compare/v0.1.0...7842495a4d64c7a3bb4339d45d6e64321d002ed8) since 0.1.0 : \r\n\r\nNew : \r\n----\r\n- Introduction of the “OneVsAll” loss function for multi-label classification, which corresponds to the sum of binary cross-entropy computed independently for each label. This new loss can be used with the `-loss ova` or `-loss one-vs-all` command line option ( 8850c51b972ed68642a15c17fbcd4dd58766291d ).\r\n- Computation of the precision and recall metrics for each label ( be1e597cb67c069ba9940ff241d9aad38ccd37da ).\r\n- Removed printing functions from `FastText` class ( 256032b87522cdebc4850c99b204b81b3255cb2a ).\r\n- Better default for number of threads ( 501b9b1e4543fd2de55e4a621a9924ce7d2b5b17 ).\r\n- Python support ( f10ec1faea1605d40fdb79fe472cc2204f3d584c ).\r\n- More tests for circleci/python ( eb9703a4a7ed0f7559d6f341cc8e5d166d5e4d88, 97fcde80ea107ca52d3d778a083564619175039c, 1de0624bfaff02d91fd265f331c07a4a0a7bb857 ).\r\n\r\nBug fixes : \r\n---------\r\n- Normalize buffer vector in analogy queries.\r\n- Typo fixes and clarifications on website.\r\n- Improvements on python install issues : `setup.py` OS X compiler flags, pybind11 include.\r\n- Fix: getSubwords for EOS.\r\n- Fix: ETA time.\r\n- Fix: division by 0 in word analogy evaluation.\r\n- Fix for the infinite loop on ARM cpu.\r\n\r\nOperations :\r\n-------------\r\n- We released more pre-trained vectors (92bc7d230959e2a94125fbe7d3b05257effb1111, 5bf8b4c615b6308d76ad39a5a50fa6c4174113ea ).\r\n\r\nWorth noting : \r\n---------------\r\n\r\n* We added circleci build badges to the `README.md`\r\n* We modified the style to be in compliance with Facebook C++ style.\r\n* We added coverage option for `Makefile` and `setup.py` in order to build for measuring the coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you fastText community!\r\n--------------------------------\r\nWe want to thank you all for being a part of this community and sharing your passion with us.

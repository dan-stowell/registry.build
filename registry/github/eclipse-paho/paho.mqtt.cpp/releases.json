Now a C++17 compiler is required to compile the library\r\n- CMake minimum required version raised to v3.13\r\n    - Need a fairly recent CMake for C++17 support (>= v3.12)\r\n    - [#504](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/issues/504) CMake v3.13 allows INSTALL(TARGETS) to work outside the current directory.\r\n- Clients always created for v5 persistence format, making it universal for any connection.\r\n    - If the application specifies a version it is kept as a hint for default connections.\r\n    - The version for the connection should be specified in the connect options.\r\n- The `create_options` now have all the parameters to create a client.\r\n    - Can specify Server URL, Client ID, and persistence in the create options.\r\n    - New client constructor that takes just the options object\r\n    - The client caches a const `create_options` struct with all the creation parameters\r\n    - Client creation internally simplified without breaking the public API\r\n- Expanded the message constmer to be a full client \"event\" consumer.\r\n    - The events are for *connected, connection_lost, disconnected, message arrived,* and application *shutdown.*\r\n    - The application can get client state change notifications without resorting to callbacks.\r\n- There's a new `persistence_type` (std::variant) that can hold any of the persistence specifiers (none, file directory, or user interface).\r\n- Most of the class static constants are now `constexpr`.\r\n- Removed the fake `ReasonCode::MQTTPP_V3_CODE`. Now all reason codes in a v3 connection are SUCCESS.\r\n- The `mqtt::exception` checks if the 'rc' return code actually contains a reason code error, amd if so, sets it as the reason code.\r\n- `property` can now report the `typeid` of its contained value.\r\n- The `properties` list implements a const iterator\r\n- Added a `to_string()` and `operator<<()` for reason codes.\r\n- `thread_queue` is now closable.\r\n- Added documentation for UNIX domain sockets coming in with Paho C v1.3.14\r\n- Removed the manual implementation of `make_unique<>()`\r\n- Added `create_options` assignment operators.\r\n- Fixed some corner cases for topic_filter::matches()\r\n- Cleaned up and fixed a number of example apps.\r\n    - Most apps now except a server URI from the command line\r\n    - 'data_publish' example uses C++17 std::filesystem for creating a file-based encrypted persistence for messages.\r\n- Updated local CI (buildtst.sh) for current compilers and unit tests.\r\n- Reorganized the source repository\r\n- Completely reformat the sources and added a .clang-format file (a project master and a slightly-different one for headers).\r\n- Added GitHub CI Action, removing legacy Travis and Appveyor files\r\n- [#410](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/issues/410) Added 'shutdown_event' to the event consumer and reworked consumer to prevent propagating exceptions on shutdown.\r\n- [#451](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/issues/451) Added low keep alive to async_publish_time to test connected/connection_lost callbacks\r\n- [#503](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/issues/503) Fixed issue that generated docs were empty.\r\n- [#518](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/pull/518) Add function for checking async consumer event queue size\r\n- [#519](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/pull/519) Fix potential deadlock in set_callback\r\n- [#524](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/issues/524) Fixed copy and move operations for 'subscribe_options'. Added unit tests.\r\n\r\nSome updates from Paho C v1.3.13\r\n1. Unix domain socket support\r\n2. HTTP proxy improvements:\r\n    - the environment variable PAHO_C_CLIENT_USE_HTTP_PROXY must be set to TRUE for http_proxy environment variable to be used\r\n    - the http_proxy environment variable to be read is lower case only\r\n    - the no_proxy environment variable can be set to exclude hosts from using an environment set proxy\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/164700867","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/164700867/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/164700867/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/tag/v1.4.1","id":164700867,"author":{"login":"fpagliughi","id":4303121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDMxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4303121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi","html_url":"https://github.com/fpagliughi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAwqMqM4J0SLD","tag_name":"v1.4.1","target_commitish":"v1.4.x","name":"Version 1.4.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-07-10T00:15:04Z","published_at":"2024-07-10T00:21:48Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/tarball/v1.4.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/zipball/v1.4.1","body":"One bug fix.\r\n\r\n- [#458](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.cpp/issues/458) Set 'disconnected' handler for the consumer queue."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/160867348","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/160867348/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/160867348/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/tag/v1.4.0","id":160867348,"author":{"login":"fpagliughi","id":4303121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDMxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4303121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi","html_url":"https://github.com/fpagliughi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAwqMqM4JlqQU","tag_name":"v1.4.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 1.4.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-06-17T13:50:51Z","published_at":"2024-06-17T13:58:52Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/tarball/v1.4.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/zipball/v1.4.0","body":"Reorganization of the sources and fixes for a number of CMake build issues, particularly to get the Paho C submodule build working with the existing C library, fixes for transient dependencies, and getting the Windows DLL (maybe, finally) working properly.\r\n\r\n- Ability to build the Paho C library automatically (now working properly)\r\n    -

These are available in the `token` objects when they complete.\r\n    - The client object tracks the desired MQTT version that the app requested and/or is currently connected at. Internally this is now required by the `response_options` the need to distinguish between pre-v5 and post-v5 callback functions.\r\n    - MQTT v5 reason codes for requests are available via `token` objects when they complete. They are also available in `exception` objects that are thrown by tokens.\r\n    - Support for subscibe options, like no local subscriptions, etc.\r\n    - Sample applications were added showing how to do basic Remote Procedure Calls (RPC's) with MQTT v5 using the *RESPONSE_TOPIC* and *CORRELATION_DATA* properties. These are *rpc_math_cli* and *rpc_math_srvr* in the _src/samples_ directory.\r\n    - A sample \"chat\" application was added, showing how to use subscribe options, such as \"no local\".\r\n- More descriptive error messages (PR #154), integrated into the `mqtt::exception` class. MQTT v5 reason codes are also included in the exceptions when an error occurs.\r\n- Applications can (finally) get server responses from the various ACK packets. These are available through the tokens after they complete, as `connect_response`, `subscribe_response`, and `unsubscribe_response`.\r\n- The `topic` objects can be used to subscribe.\r\n- Applications can register individual callback functions instead of using a `callback` interface object. This allows easy use of lambda functions for callbacks.\r\n- The connect options can take a LWT as a plain message, via `connect_options::set_will_message()` \r\n- New unit tests have started using _Catch2_.\r\n- Tested with Paho C v1.3.1\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/14490607","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/14490607/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/14490607/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/releases/tag/v1.0.1","id":14490607,"author":{"login":"fpagliughi","id":4303121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDMxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4303121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi","html_url":"https://github.com/fpagliughi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpagliughi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE0NDkwNjA3","tag_name":"v1.0.1","target_commitish":"master","name":"Version 1.0.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2018-12-12T13:24:25Z","published_at":"2018-12-12T13:32:45Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/tarball/v1.0.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.cpp/zipball/v1.0.1","body":"This is a bug-fix released aimed mainly at issues with the build system and working towards more \"modern\" usage of CMake.

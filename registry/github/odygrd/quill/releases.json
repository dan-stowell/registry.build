API Changes\r\n\r\n- Replaced the `bool huge_pages_enabled` flag in `FrontendOptions` with `quill::HugePagesPolicy huge_pages_policy` enum, allowing huge page allocation to be attempted with a fallback to normal pages if unavailable. If you are using a custom `FrontendOptions` type, you will need to update it to use the new flag. ([#707](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/707))\r\n- Previously, `QueueType::UnboundedDropping` and `QueueType::UnboundedBlocking` could grow up to 2 GB in size. This limit is now configurable via `FrontendOptions::unbounded_queue_max_capacity`, which defaults to 2 GB.\r\n- `QueueType::UnboundedUnlimited` has been removed, as the same behavior can now be achieved by setting `FrontendOptions::unbounded_queue_max_capacity` to the maximum value.\r\n- The `ConsoleSink` constructor now optionally accepts a `ConsoleSinkConfig`, similar to other sinks. If no `ConsoleSinkConfig` is provided, a default one is used, logging to `stdout` with `ColourMode::Automatic`. For example:\r\n    ```c++\r\n    Frontend::create_or_get_sink<ConsoleSink>(\"console_sink\",\r\n                                              []()\r\n                                              {\r\n                                                ConsoleSinkConfig config;\r\n                                                config.set_colour_mode(ConsoleSinkConfig::ColourMode::Never);\r\n                                                config.set_stream(\"stderr\");\r\n                                                return config;\r\n                                              }());\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- The default log level for each `Logger` can now be configured using the environment variable `QUILL_LOG_LEVEL`. Supported values: `\"tracel3\"`, `\"tracel2\"`, `\"tracel1\"`, `\"debug\"`, `\"info\"`, `\"notice\"`, `\"warning\"`, `\"error\"`, `\"critical\"`, `\"none\"`. When set, the logger is initialized with the corresponding log level. If `logger->set_log_level(level)` is explicitly called in code, it will override the log level set via the environment variable.\r\n- Added the `LOG_RUNTIME_METADATA(logger, log_level, file, line_number, function, fmt, ...)` macro. This enables passing runtime metadata (such as file, line number, and function) along with a log message, providing greater flexibility when forwarding logs from other logging libraries. ([#696](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/696))\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    LOG_RUNTIME_METADATA(logger, quill::LogLevel::Info, \"main.cpp\", 20, \"foo()\", \"Hello number {}\", 8);\r\n    ```\r\n- Added a runtime check to detect duplicate backend worker threads caused by inconsistent linkage (e.g., mixing static and shared libraries). If needed, this check can be disabled using the   `check_backend_singleton_instance` flag in `BackendOptions`. ([#687](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/discussions/687#discussioncomment-12349621))\r\n- Added the `QUILL_DISABLE_FUNCTION_NAME` preprocessor flag and CMake option. This allows disabling `__FUNCTION__` in `LOG_*` macros when `%(caller_function)` is not used in `PatternFormatter`, eliminating Clang-Tidy warnings when logging inside lambdas.\r\n- It is now possible to override a logger's `PatternFormatter` on a per-sink basis. This allows the same logger to output different formats for different sinks. Previously, achieving this required creating a custom sink type, but this functionality is now built-in. See the example: [sink_formatter_override](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/sink_formatter_override.cpp).\r\n- Added `Frontend::remove_logger_blocking(...)`, which blocks the caller thread until the specified logger is fully removed.\r\n- Added `Frontend::shrink_thread_local_queue(capacity)` and `Frontend::get_thread_local_queue_capacity()`. These functions allow dynamic management of thread-local SPSC queues when using an unbounded queue configuration. They enable on-demand shrinking of a queue that has grown due to bursty logging, helping to reduce memory usage, although in typical scenarios they won't be required.\r\n- Added the `SyslogSink`, which logs messages to the system's syslog.\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto sink = quill::Frontend::create_or_get_sink<quill::SyslogSink>(\r\n      \"app\", []()\r\n      {\r\n        quill::SyslogSinkConfig config;\r\n        config.set_identifier(\"app\");\r\n        return config;\r\n      }());\r\n    ```\r\n- Added the `SystemdSink`, which logs messages to systemd.\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto sink = quill::Frontend::create_or_get_sink<quill::SystemdSink>(\r\n      \"app\", []()\r\n      {\r\n        quill::SystemdSinkConfig config;\r\n        config.set_identifier(\"app\");\r\n        return config;\r\n      }());\r\n    ```  \r\n- Added the `AndroidSink`, which integrates with Android's logging system.\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto sink = quill::Frontend::create_or_get_sink<quill::AndroidSink>(\r\n      \"s1\", []()\r\n      {\r\n        quill::AndroidSinkConfig config;\r\n        config.set_tag(\"app\");\r\n        config.set_format_message(true);\r\n        return config;\r\n      }());\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- Updated bundled `libfmt` to `11.1.4`.\r\n- When `add_metadata_to_multi_line_logs` in the `PatternFormatter` was set to false, fixed a bug where the last character of the log message was dropped and added protection for empty messages.\r\n- Updated `LOG_EVERY_N` macros to log on the first occurrence (0th call) instead of waiting until the Nth call.\r\n- Added a `nullptr` check for `char*` and `const char*` during encoding, ensuring the library handles `nullptr` values gracefully ([#735](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/discussions/735))\r\n- The `CsvWriter` could previously be used with `RotatingFileSink` via the constructor that accepted `std::shared_ptr<Sink>`, but rotated files did not include the CSV header. This has now been improved—when using the new constructor that accepts `quill::RotatingFileSinkConfig`, the CSV header is written at the start of each new rotated file. ([#700](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/discussions/700))\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    quill::RotatingFileSinkConfig sink_config;\r\n    sink_config.set_open_mode('w');\r\n    sink_config.set_filename_append_option(FilenameAppendOption::None);\r\n    sink_config.set_rotation_max_file_size(512);\r\n    sink_config.set_rotation_naming_scheme(RotatingFileSinkConfig::RotationNamingScheme::Index);\r\n    \r\n    quill::CsvWriter<OrderCsvSchema, quill::FrontendOptions> csv_writer{\"orders.csv\", sink_config};\r\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < 40; ++i)\r\n    {\r\n      csv_writer.append_row(132121122 + i, \"AAPL\", i, 100.1, \"BUY\");\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n- When using `CsvWriter` with `open_mode == 'a'`, the header will no longer be rewritten if the file already exists.\r\n- On Linux, setting a long backend thread name now truncates it instead of failing. ([#691](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/691))\r\n- Fixed BSD builds.

`DeferredFormatCodec` now supports both trivially and non-trivially copyable types:\r\n    - For trivially copyable types, it behaves the same as `TriviallyCopyableTypeCodec`.\r\n    - For non-trivially copyable types, it works similarly to pre-`v4` by taking a copy of the object using the copy constructor and placement new.\r\n  - `DirectFormatCodec` formats the object immediately in the hot path, serving as a shortcut to explicitly formatting the object when logging.\r\n  - For advanced use cases, a custom `Codec` can still be defined for finer control over encoding/decoding.\r\n\r\n  See:\r\n  - [DeferredFormatCodec Usage](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/user_defined_types_logging_deferred_format.cpp)\r\n  - [DirectFormatCodec

Setting this value to 0 disables the feature. ([#641](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/641))\r\n- Added a `StopWatch` utility for easy logging of elapsed time.

The frontend will no longer include `windows.h`. By following the recommended usage example provided [here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/recommended_usage/recommended_usage.cpp) as guidance, you can create a wrapper library around Quill for the backend, allowing you to log on Windows without including `windows.h` in the frontend or main program.

Fixes:**\r\n\r\n- Fixed compile error in `BackendTscClock` ([#577](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/577))\r\n- Added a missing header include in `TriviallyCopyableCodec.h`. ([#560](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/560))\r\n- Fixed incorrect log level short codes introduced in v7 after adding the new log level `NOTICE`. Using `%(log_level_short_code)` in the pattern formatter could incorrectly map `LOG_ERROR` to `\"C\"` and LOG_WARNING to `\"E\"`. ([#564](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/564))\r\n- Fixed an overflow issue when logging more than `uint32_t::max()` bytes in a single log message. For example, attempting to log `std::string s(std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max(), 'a');` would previously cause a crash.\r\n\r\n**Improvements:**\r\n\r\n- Optimised dynamic log level handling and size calculation for fundamental types, `std::string` and `std::string_view` on the hot path.\r\n- Several enhancements to the backend worker thread, resulting in an overall 10% backend throughput increase. Key optimizations include the simplification of `TransitEventBuffer`, reducing the memory footprint of `TransitEvent`, introducing support for custom buffer sizes in file streams and tuning `transit_events_soft_limit` and `transit_events_hard_limit` default values\r\n- Improved readability of queue allocation notification messages. Capacities are now displayed in KiB, e.g., `20:59:25 Quill INFO: Allocated a new SPSC queue with a capacity of 1024 KB (previously 512 KB) from thread 31158`.\r\n\r\n**New Features:**\r\n\r\n- Introduced support for custom buffer sizes in file streams for `FileSink` and `RotatingFileSink`. Buffer size is now configurable via `FileSinkConfig::set_write_buffer_size(size_value)` with a default of 64 KB.\r\n- Added an optional `fsync` interval to control the minimum time between consecutive `fsync` calls, reducing disk wear from frequent fsync operations. This option is only applicable when `fsync` is enabled. ([#557](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/557))\r\n- Implemented support for appending a custom timestamp format to log filenames via `StartCustomTimestampFormat`.\r\n  Example usage:\r\n  ```cpp\r\n  auto file_sink = quill::Frontend::create_or_get_sink<quill::FileSink>(\"logfile.log\", []()\r\n  {\r\n    quill::FileSinkConfig cfg;\r\n    cfg.set_filename_append_option(quill::FilenameAppendOption::StartCustomTimestampFormat, \"%m%d\");\r\n    return cfg;\r\n  }());\r\n  ```\r\n  This will create a log file named `logfile0919.log`, where `0919` represents the month and day.\r\n- When using `%(named_args)` in the pattern formatter or logging in JSON format, extra arguments without key names are now included in JSON output with keys corresponding to their positional indexes. This allows additional details to be included in the JSON while keeping the log message clean. For example ([#563](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/discussions/563)):\r\n  ```cpp\r\n  LOG_INFO(hybrid_logger, \"Operation {name} completed with code {code}\", \"Update\", 123, \"Data synced successfully\");\r\n  ```\r\n  This will output:\r\n  ```\r\n  Operation Update completed with code 123\r\n  ```\r\n  And the corresponding JSON will be:\r\n  ```\r\n  {\"timestamp\":\"1726582319816776867\",\"file_name\":\"json_file_logging.cpp\",\"line\":\"71\",\"thread_id\":\"25462\",\"logger\":\"hybrid_logger\",\"log_level\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"Operation {name} completed with code {code}\",\"name\":\"Update\",\"code\":\"123\",\"_2\":\"Data synced successfully\"}\r\n  ```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/176281266/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/174038970","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/174038970/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/174038970/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/tag/v7.1.0","id":174038970,"author":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDODfWAZs4KX5-6","tag_name":"v7.1.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v7.1.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-09-09T01:05:09Z","published_at":"2024-09-09T01:43:20Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/releases/assets/191346809","id":191346809,"node_id":"RA_kwDODfWAZs4LZ7h5","name":"quill-7.1.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"odygrd","id":7397786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7397786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd","html_url":"https://github.com/odygrd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odygrd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-zip-compressed","state":"uploaded","size":2927187,"digest":null,"download_count":357,"created_at":"2024-09-09T01:43:35Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T01:43:36Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/odygrd/quill/releases/download/v7.1.0/quill-7.1.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/tarball/v7.1.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/odygrd/quill/zipball/v7.1.0","body":"- Fixed crash when using `QueueType::BoundedDropping` or `QueueType::UnboundedDropping` after a message drops.

The `Tags` class has been removed. You now pass a `char const*` directly to the macros.\r\n  Additionally, macros previously named `WITH_TAGS` have been renamed to `_TAGS`. For example, `LOG_INFO_WITH_TAGS` is\r\n  now `LOG_INFO_TAGS`.\r\n- Renamed `backend_cpu_affinity` to `cpu_affinity` in `BackendOptions` to improve consistency.\r\n- Simplified project structure by removing the extra quill directory and made minor CMake improvements; `include/quill` is now directly in the root.\r\n- Added support for `std::string` with custom allocator. ([#524](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/524))\r\n- Added a new log level `NOTICE`, for capturing significant events that aren't errors or warnings. It fits between `INFO` and `WARNING` for logging important runtime events that require attention. ([#526](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/526))\r\n- Enhanced static assert error message for unsupported codecs, providing clearer guidance for STL and user-defined types.\r\n- Improved frontend performance by caching the `ThreadContext` pointer in `Logger` class to avoid repeated function calls. On Linux, this is now further optimised with `__thread` for thread-local storage, while other platforms still use `thread_local`.\r\n- Minor performance enhancement in the frontend by replacing `std::vector<size_t>` with an `InlinedVector<uint32_t, 12>` for caching sizes (e.g. string arguments).\r\n- Fixed order of evaluation for `Codec::pair<T1,T2>::compute_encoded_size()` to prevent side effects observed on MSVC\r\n- Introduced the `add_metadata_to_multi_line_logs` option in `PatternFormatter`. This option, now enabled by default, appends metadata such as timestamps and log levels to every line of multiline log entries, ensuring consistent log output. To restore the previous behavior, set this option to false when creating a `Logger` using `Frontend::create_or_get_logger(...)`. Note that this option is ignored when logging JSON using named arguments in the format message. ([#534](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/pull/534))\r\n- `JSON` sinks now automatically remove any `\\n` characters from format messages, ensuring the emission of valid `JSON` messages even when `\\n` is present in the format.\r\n- Replaced `static` variables with `static constexpr` in the `ConsoleColours` class.\r\n- Fixed compiler errors in a few rarely used macros. Added a comprehensive test for all macros to prevent similar issues in the future.\r\n- Expanded terminal list for color detection in console applications on Linux\r\n- Fixed an issue where `char*` and `char[]` types could be incorrectly selected by the Codec template in `Array.h`\r\n- The library no longer defines `__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__`, as the bounds-checking functions from the extensions are no longer needed.\r\n- `StringFromTime` constructor no longer relies on the system's current time, improving performance in simulations where timestamps differ from system time. ([#541](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/541))\r\n- The `Frontend::create_or_get_logger(...)` function now accepts a `PatternFormatterOptions` parameter, simplifying the API. This is a breaking change. To migrate quickly, wrap the existing formatting parameters in a `PatternFormatterOptions` object.\r\n\r\n  **Before:**\r\n  ```c++\r\n    quill::Logger* logger =\r\n      quill::Frontend::create_or_get_logger(\"root\", std::move(file_sink),\r\n                                            \"%(time) [%(thread_id)] %(short_source_location:<28) \"\r\n

```c++\r\n    quill::Logger* logger =\r\n      quill::Frontend::create_or_get_logger(\"root\", std::move(file_sink), quill::PatternFormatterOptions {\r\n

This feature is intended for advanced use cases where greater control over threading is required. ([#519](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/519))\r\n- Add new `CsvWriter` utility class for asynchronous CSV file writing.

This bug affected timezones that did not have an exact hour difference from UTC, leading to incorrect timestamp calculations. ([#498](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/498))\r\n- The newline character `\\n` is now considered printable by default and will no longer be sanitized. Users can now include new lines in their logs directly. In versions `4.4.1` and earlier, `\\n` was not sanitized, and this behavior is restored in this update, eliminating the need for a custom `check_printable_char` function in `BackendOptions`.\r\n- On Windows, when colors are enabled in `ConsoleSink`, `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo` may fail in the debug console. Previously, this would result in an error being displayed but no logs being written. This issue is now resolved: the error is reported once, and logs will be written to the console without colors.\r\n- Improved performance of `StringFromTime` and `TimestampFormatter` used by the backend worker thread.\r\n- Replaced `std::mutex` with a spinlock, resulting in minor performance improvement for backend worker.

Wide string functionality has now been moved to a separate header file, `WideStrings.h`. On Windows, logging wide strings now requires the inclusion of `quill/std/WideStrings.h`.\r\n\r\n- Added `QUILL_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH` preprocessor variable. This variable can be defined before including `LogMacros.h` or passed as a compiler flag. When `QUILL_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH` is defined, the library will flush the log on each log statement. This causes the caller thread to wait for the log to be processed and written to the log file by the backend thread before continuing, significantly impacting performance. This feature is useful for debugging the application when synchronized logs are required. ([#488](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/488))\r\n\r\n- Introduced `log_level_descriptions` and `log_level_short_codes` in `BackendOptions` to allow customization of `LogLevel` descriptions and short codes, replacing previously hardcoded values. This enhancement enables users to define their own descriptions and short codes for each log level. For instance, instead of displaying `LOG_WARNING`, it can now be configured to show `LOG_WARN`.

These new macros simplify logging by automatically printing variable names and values without explicitly specifying each variable name or using `{}` placeholders in the format string. Each macro can handle up to 26 arguments. The format string is concatenated at compile time, there is no runtime overhead for using these macros. For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    int a = 123;\r\n    double b = 3.17;\r\n    LOGV_INFO(logger, \"A message with two variables\", a, b)\r\n  ```\r\n  outputs `A message with two variables [a: 123, b: 3.17]`\r\n\r\n- Introduced `LOGJ_LEVEL`, `LOGJ_LEVEL_LIMIT`, and `LOGJ_LEVEL_WITH_TAGS` macros. These new macros simplify JSON logging by automatically embedding the name of each passed variable as a named argument in the format string. Each macro can handle up to 26 arguments. The format string is concatenated at compile time, there is no runtime overhead for using these macros. For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n    int var_a = 123;\r\n    std::string var_b = \"test\";\r\n    LOGJ_INFO(logger, \"A json message\", var_a, var_b);\r\n  ```\r\n  outputs `{\"log_level\":\"INFO\",\"message\":\"A json message {var_a}, {var_b}\",\"var_a\":\"123\",\"var_b\":\"test\"}`\r\n\r\n- Enhanced the `filter` function to also receive the formatted `log_message` alongside the log_statement, enabling the comparison and filtering of `log_message` while disregarding elements like timestamps from the full `log_statement`. ([#493](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/493))\r\n\r\n- Renamed `log_message` to `log_statement` and `should_log_message` to `should_log_statement` in `Logger`\r\n- Replaced `%(log_level_id)` with `%(log_level_short_code)` in the `PatternFormatter`.\r\n\r\n- Fix a `CMakeLists` error for old `CMake` versions prior to `3.19`.

This enhancement supports use cases where the formatted `log_statement` passed to the `Sink` can be ignored and overwritten with a custom format, allowing a single `Logger` to output different formats to various `Sinks` ([#476](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/issues/476))\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug in JSON logging where previously cached named arguments could erroneously append to subsequent log statements.

Taking a look at some compiler profiling for a `Release` build with\r\n  clang 15, we can see the difference. Below are the two compiler flamegraphs for building the `recommended_usage`\r\n  example from the new version and the `wrapper_lib` example from the previous version.\r\n\r\nThe below flamegraph shows the difference in included headers between the two versions\r\n\r\n| Version |                                     Compiler FlameGraph                                      |\r\n|---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\r\n| v4.0.0  | ![quill_v4_compiler_profile.speedscope.png](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/docs/quill_v4_compiler_profile.speedscope.png) |\r\n| v3.8.0  | ![quill_v3_compiler_profile.speedscope.png](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/docs/quill_v3_compiler_profile.speedscope.png) |\r\n\r\nA new compiler benchmark has been introduced. A Python script generates 2000 distinct log statements with various\r\narguments. You can find the benchmark [here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/benchmarks/compile_time/compile_time_bench.cpp).\r\nCompilation now takes only about 30 seconds, whereas the previous version required over 4 minutes.\r\n\r\n| Version |                                   Compiler FlameGraph                                    |\r\n|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\r\n| v4.0.0  | ![quill_v4_compiler_bench.speedscope.png](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/docs/quill_v4_compiler_bench.speedscope.png) |\r\n| v3.8.0  | ![quill_v3_compiler_bench.speedscope.png](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/docs/quill_v4_compiler_profile.speedscope.png) |\r\n\r\n- Minor increase in backend thread throughput compared to the previous version.\r\n\r\n| Version |                                 Backend Throughput                                 |\r\n|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\r\n| v4.0.0  | 4.56 million msgs/sec average, total time elapsed: 876 ms for 4000000 log messages |\r\n| v3.8.0  | 4.39 million msgs/sec average, total time elapsed: 910 ms for 4000000 log messages |\r\n\r\n- Significant boost in hot path latency when logging complex types such as `std::vector`.\r\n  The performance remains consistent when logging only primitive types or strings in both versions.

Refactoring efforts have focused on\r\ndecoupling the frontend from the backend, resulting in reduced dependencies. Accessing the frontend logging functions\r\nnow does not demand inclusion of any backend logic components.\r\n\r\n     \"quill/Backend.h\" - It can be included once to start the backend logging thread, typically in main.cpp \r\n                         or in a wrapper library.\r\n     \r\n     \"quill/Frontend.h\"` - Used to create or obtain a `Logger*` or a `Sink`. It can be included in limited \r\n                           files, since an obtained `Logger*` has pointer stability and can be passed around.\r\n     \r\n     \"quill/Logger.h\", \"quill/LogMacros.h\" - These two files are the only ones needed for logging and will have \r\n                                             to be included in every file that requires logging functionality.\r\n\r\n- **Backend formatting for user-defined and standard library types**\r\n\r\nOne of the significant changes lies in the support for formatting both user-defined and standard library types.\r\nPreviously, the backend thread handled the formatting of these types sent by the frontend. It involved making a copy for\r\nany object passed to the `LOG_` macros as an argument using the copy constructor of a complex type instead of directly\r\nserializing the data to the SPSC queue. While this method facilitated logging copy-constructible user-defined types with\r\nease, it also posed numerous challenges for asynchronous logging:\r\n\r\n- Error-Prone Asynchronous Logging: Copying and formatting user-defined types on the backend thread in an\r\n  asynchronous logging setup could lead to errors. Previous versions attempted to address this issue with type\r\n  trait checks, which incurred additional template instantiations and compile times.\r\n- Uncertainty in Type Verification: It is challenging to confidently verify types, as some trivially copiable\r\n  types, such as `struct A { int* m; }`, could still lead to issues due to potential modifications by the user\r\n  before formatting.\r\n- Hidden Performance Penalties: Logging non-trivially copiable types could introduce hidden cache coherence\r\n  performance penalties due to memory allocations and deallocations across threads. For instance,\r\n  consider `std::vector<int>` passed as a log argument. The vector is emplaced into the SPSC queue by the frontend,\r\n  invoking the copy constructor dynamically allocating memory as the only members copied to SPSC queue\r\n  are `size`, `capacity`, and `data*`. The backend thread reads the object, formats it, and then invokes the destructor,\r\n  which in turn synchronizes the\r\n  freed memory back to the frontend.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, after years of professional use and based on experience, it has been observed that user-defined types\r\nare often logged during program initialization, with fewer occurrences on the hot path where mostly built-in types are\r\nlogged. In such scenarios, the overhead of string formatting on the frontend during initialization is not an issue.\r\n\r\nIn this new version, the use of the copy constructor for emplacing objects in the queue has been abandoned. Only POD\r\ntypes are copied, ensuring that only raw, tangible data is handled without any underlying pointers pointing to other\r\nmemory locations. The only exception to this are the pointers to `Metadata`, `LoggerBase` and `DecodeFunction`\r\nthat are passed internally for each log message. Log arguments sent from the frontend must undergo\r\nserialization beforehand. While this approach resolves the above issues, it does introduce more complexity when\r\ndealing with user-defined or standard library types.\r\n\r\nBuilt-in types and strings are logged by default, with the formatting being offloaded to the backend. Additionally,\r\nthere is built-in support for most standard library types, which can also be directly passed to the logger by\r\nincluding the relevant header from `quill/std`.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation for user-defined types is to format them into strings before passing them to the `LOG_` macros using\r\nyour preferred method. You can find an example of this [here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/user_defined_types_logging.cpp).\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to extend the library by providing template specializations to serialize the user-defined types\r\nand offload their formatting to the backend. However, this approach should only be pursued if you cannot tolerate the\r\nformatting overhead in that part of your program. For further guidance, refer to [this example](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/advanced/advanced.cpp).\r\n\r\n- **Header-Only library**\r\n\r\nThe library is now header-only. This change simplifies exporting the library as a C++ module in the future. See\r\n[here](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/recommended_usage/recommended_usage.cpp) on how to build a wrapper static library which includes the backend and will minimise the compile times.\r\n\r\n- **Preprocessor flags moved to template parameters**\r\n\r\nMost preprocessor flags have been moved to template parameters, with only a few remaining as `CMake` options. This\r\nchange simplifies exporting the library as a C++ module in the future.\r\n\r\n- **Renamed Handlers to Sinks**\r\n\r\nTo enhance clarity, handlers have been renamed to sinks.\r\n\r\n- **PatternFormatter moved to Logger**\r\n\r\nThe `PatternFormatter` has been relocated from `Sink` to `Logger`, enabling a logger object to log in a specific\r\nformat. This allows for different formats within the same output file, a feature not previously possible.\r\n\r\n- **Split Configuration**\r\n\r\nThe configuration settings have been divided into `FrontendOptions` and `BackendOptions`.\r\n\r\n- **Refactoring of backend classes**\r\n\r\n`MacroMetadata` and many backend classes have undergone refactoring, resulting in reduced memory requirements.\r\n\r\n- **Improved wide strings handling on Windows**\r\n\r\nThe library now offers significant performance enhancements for handling wide strings on Windows platforms.\r\nIt's important to note that only wide strings containing ASCII characters are supported. Previously, wide strings were\r\nconverted to narrow strings at the frontend, impacting the critical path of the application.\r\nWith this update, the underlying wide char buffer is copied and the conversion to UTF-8 encoding is deferred to\r\nthe backend logging thread. Additionally, this update adds support for logging STL containers consisting of\r\nwide strings\r\n\r\n- **Default logger removal**\r\n\r\nThe default logger, along with the configuration inheritance feature during logger creation, has been removed. Now, when\r\ncreating a new logger instance, configurations such as the `Sink` and log pattern format must be explicitly specified\r\neach time. This simplifies the codebase.\r\n\r\n- **Global logger removal**\r\n\r\nThe static global logger* variable that was initialised during `quill::start()` used to obtain the default logger has\r\nbeen removed. It is possible to add this on the user side. If you require a global logger you can have a look\r\nat [this example](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/recommended_usage/recommended_usage.cpp)\r\n\r\n- **Removal of printf style formatting support**\r\n\r\nThe support for `printf` style formatting has been removed due to its limited usage and the increased complexity. Users\r\nrequiring this feature should stay on `v3.x.x` versions to maintain compatibility.\r\n\r\n- **Removal of external libfmt usage**\r\n\r\nThe option to build the library with external `libfmt` has been removed. It becomes difficult to maintain and backwards\r\nsupport previous versions of `libfmt`. Instead, `libfmt` is now an internal component of the library, accessible under\r\nthe namespace `fmtquill`. You can use the bundled version of `fmtquill` by including the necessary headers from\r\n`quill/bundled/fmt`. Alternatively, you have the freedom to integrate your own version. Since `libfmt` is encapsulated\r\nwithin a distinct namespace, there are no conflicts even if you link your own `libfmt` alongside the logging library.\r\n\r\n#### Migration Guidance\r\n\r\n- Revise include files to accommodate the removal of `Quill.h`\r\n- Update the code that starts the backend thread and the logger/sink creation. You can refer to any of the\r\n  updated examples, such as [this one](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/file_logging.cpp)\r\n- When logging statements involving user-defined types, make sure these types are formatted into strings using\r\n  your preferred method. Refer to [this link](https://github.com/odygrd/quill/blob/master/examples/user_defined_types_logging.cpp) for guidance. Alternatively, if you prefer delaying the conversion to strings until the backend thread and only passing a binary copy of the user-defined type on the hot path, you can provide the necessary class template specializations for each user-defined type.

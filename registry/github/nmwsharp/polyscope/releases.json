represents a whole bunch of changes that had accumulated over the past >2 years.\r\n\r\nKey new features:\r\n\r\n- New structure: Camera View. Represents a camera in the scene, add images/renderings and view them through the camera's perspective.\r\n- New structure: Volume Grid. Values on the nodes or cells of a regular grid in 3D space. Visualize with slices through the grid, or view levelsets via marching cubes.\r\n- New quantity: color & scalar images. These are a new kind of 'floating' quantity, add them to the whole scene, or to any structure.\r\n- New quantity: render images. Images that represent renderings of the scene, and can depth-composite with other content, etc.\r\n- New quantity: mesh texture images. Texture-mapped color and scalar values on meshes.\r\n- Alternate control flow method for simulations & interactive apps that already have a main loop.\r\n- Flat material circumvents shading & tonemapping to display colors onscreen exactly as specified.\r\n- More helper functions for manipulating views and getting info about mouse clicks.\r\n- C++ data adaptor taking {ptr, size} to from any flat buffer for adding structures & quantities.\r\n- Surface Meshes no longer let you select halfedges/edges by default\r\n- Big backend perf & memory improvements. Added shader cache. Total rewrite of backed data management, so we never store duplicate copies of data. Updating data in a tight loop should be much faster now.\r\n- Beta/partial/undocumented support for directly updating buffers from the GPU without a CPU round-trip.\r\n- Cleaned up docs website to scale better to more content. New FAQ section.\r\n\r\nJust a few small breaking changes:\r\n- Rename intrinsic vector quantities to tangent. Change interpretation of symmetric data. Track bases per-quantity rather than per-structure.\r\n- Remove ability to set vertex- and face- permutations for surface meshes.\r\n- Remove poorly-supported surface mesh quantities: surface graph (superseded by Curve Network), count quantity, subset quantity","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nmwsharp/polyscope/releases/135317346/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":3,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":2,"eyes":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nmwsharp/polyscope/releases/54454850","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nmwsharp/polyscope/releases/54454850/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/nmwsharp/polyscope/releases/54454850/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/nmwsharp/polyscope/releases/tag/v1.3.0","id":54454850,"author":{"login":"nmwsharp","id":12726725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzI2NzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12726725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp","html_url":"https://github.com/nmwsharp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmwsharp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBqZY1M4DPupC","tag_name":"v1.3.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"v1.3.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-12-01T22:59:56Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T00:28:23Z","published_at":"2021-12-02T00:28:23Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nmwsharp/polyscope/tarball/v1.3.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nmwsharp/polyscope/zipball/v1.3.0","body":"Adds

If `true`, reads out of range floating point numbers \r\n    as strings with tag `semantic_tag::bigdec`. Defaults to true.\r\n\r\n    - New reflection trait definitions, `jsoncons::reflect::json_conv_traits`, that support non-throwing conversions and uses-allocator construction.\r\n      These replace `jsoncons::json_type_traits`, but for backwards compatibility, `json_conv_traits` defaults to `json_type_traits` if a type conversion is undefined.\r\n\r\n    - New non-throwing versions of the decode functions that return a `std::expected`-like result (like `std::expected<T,jsoncons::read_error>`),\r\n\r\n        - `try_decode_json`\r\n        - `try_decode_csv`\r\n        - `try_decode_bson`\r\n        - `try_decode_cbor`\r\n        - `try_decode_msgpack`\r\n        - `try_decode_ubjson`\r\n\r\n    - New non-throwing versions of the encode functions that return a `std::expected`-like result (like `std::expected<void,jsoncons::write_error>`),\r\n\r\n        - `try_encode_json`\r\n        - `try_encode_csv`\r\n        - `try_encode_bson`\r\n        - `try_encode_cbor`\r\n        - `try_encode_msgpack`\r\n        - `try_encode_ubjson`\r\n\r\n    - New non-throwing accessor `try_as<T>()` for `basic_json` that return a `std::expected<T,conversion_error>`-like result,\r\n\r\n- Changes\r\n\r\n    - Until now, the reflection traits generated by the convenience macros `JSONCONS_ALL_MEMBER_TRAITS`\r\n      etc. produced JSON (or other formats) with object names in sorted order. After this release,\r\n      they will produce JSON, BSON etc. with object names in the order that they appear as macro arguments. \r\n\r\n    - The `allocator_set` helper functions `combine_allocators` and `temp_allocator_only` have been \r\n      deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use `make_alloc_set` instead.\r\n\r\n    - The `jsoncons::csv::result_options::value` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a\r\n      future release. See [What does result_options::value do in json_query()?](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/discussions/613)\r\n      for the rationale for this change. Use `jsoncons::csv::result_options{}` instead.\r\n\r\n    - `basic_json::dump` and `encode_json` overloads that take a `jsoncons::indenting` argument have been\r\n      deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the `_pretty` overloads (introduced in 0.155.0) \r\n      for prettified output (line indentation.) \r\n\r\n- Breaking change to staj iterator classes\r\n\r\n    - Classes `staj_array_view` and `staj_object_view` and corresponding factories `staj_array` \r\n       and `staj_object` have been removed.\r\n    - `staj_array_iterator` and `staj_object_iterator` objects are now constructed directly \r\n      from a cursor rather than through one of these view objects.\r\n    - Classes `staj_array_iterator` and `staj_object_iterator` now have `begin` and `end`\r\n      non-member functions for range-based for loop support.  \r\n\r\n    We don't expect this change will affect many users.

The rationale for this change is given in Git Issue \r\n    #315.  The new behavior for the non-const overload of `operator[](const \r\n    string_view_type& key)` is to return a reference to the value that is \r\n    associated with `key`, inserting a default constructed value with the key \r\n    if no such key already exists, which is consistent with the standard \r\n    library `std::map` behavior.  The new behavior for the const overload of \r\n    `operator[](const string_view_type& key)` is to return a const reference \r\n    to the value that is associated with `key`, returning a const reference to \r\n    a default constructed value with static storage duration if no such key \r\n    already exists.  \r\n\r\n    - Until 1.0.0, a buffer of text is supplied to `basic_json_parser` with a \r\n    call to `update()` followed by a call to `parse_some()`.  Once the parser \r\n    reaches the end of the buffer, additional JSON text can be supplied to the \r\n    parser with another call to `update()`, followed by another call to \r\n    `parse_some()`.  See [Incremental parsing (until \r\n    1.0.0)](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/blob/master/doc/ref/corelib/basic_json_parser.md#incremental-parsing-until-01790).  \r\n    Since 0.179, an initial buffer of text is supplied to the parse with a \r\n    call to `set_buffer`, and parsing commences with a call to `parse_some`.  \r\n    The parser can be constructed with a user provided chunk reader to obtain \r\n    additional JSON text as needed.  See [Incremental parsing (since \r\n    1.0.0)](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/blob/master/doc/ref/corelib/basic_json_parser.md#incremental-parsing-since-01790).  \r\n\r\n    - enum `bigint_chars_format` is deprecated and replaced by \r\n    `bignum_format_kind`.  Added `bignum_format` getter and setter functions \r\n    to `basic_json_options`, and deprecated `bigint_format` getter and setter \r\n    functions.  Changed default `bignum_format` from \r\n    `bigint_chars_format::base10` to `bignum_format_kind::raw`.  Rationale: \r\n    `bigint_chars_format` was misnamed, as it applied to `bigdec` as well as \r\n    `bigint` numbers, and defaulting to `bigint_chars_format::base10` produced \r\n    surprising results for users of our lossless number option.  \r\n\r\n    - The URI argument passed to the jsonschema ResolveURI function object now \r\n    included the fragment part of the URI.  \r\n\r\n- Fixed bugs:\r\n\r\n    - Git Issue #554: [jsonpath] evaluation throws on json containing json_const_pointer\r\n\r\n    - Git PR #560: [jmespath] When there are elements and the sum is indeed zero, avg function should return average value returned instead of a null value.\r\n\r\n    - Git Issue #561: json_string_reader does not work correctly for empty string or string with all blanks\r\n\r\n    - Git Issue #564: Fixed basic_json compare of double and non-numeric string\r\n\r\n    - Git Issue #570: Fixed writing fixed number of map value/value pairs using cbor_encoder and msgpack_encoder\r\n\r\n    - Fixed a number of issues in `uri::resolve`, used in jsonschema, related to abnormal references,\r\n    particulay ones containing dots in path segments. \r\n\r\n- Removed deprecated classes and functions:\r\n\r\n    - The jsonschema function `make_schema`, classes `json_validator` and `validation_output`,\r\n    header file `json_validator.hpp` and example `legacy_jsonschema_examples.cpp`, \r\n    deprecated in 0.174.0, have been removed.\r\n\r\n- Enhancements:\r\n\r\n    - Added stream output operator (`<<`) to uri class.\r\n\r\n    - Added `basic_json(json_pointer_arg_t, basic_json* j)` constructor to \r\n    allow a `basic_json` value to contain a non-owning view of another `basic_json`\r\n    value.\r\n\r\n    - Added constant `null_arg` so that a null json value can be \r\n    constructed with\r\n    ```\r\n        json j{jsoncons::null_arg};\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    - Custom jmespath functions are now supported thanks to PR #560\r\n\r\n    - jsonschema now understands the 'uri' and 'uri-reference' formats\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielaparker/jsoncons/releases/182917225","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielaparker/jsoncons/releases/182917225/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/danielaparker/jsoncons/releases/182917225/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/releases/tag/v0.178.0","id":182917225,"author":{"login":"danielaparker","id":4381912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODE5MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4381912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker","html_url":"https://github.com/danielaparker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielaparker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOAJfMu84K5xhp","tag_name":"v0.178.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Release 0.178.0","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2024-10-31T13:20:33Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T13:23:10Z","published_at":"2024-10-31T13:22:10Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielaparker/jsoncons/tarball/v0.178.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danielaparker/jsoncons/zipball/v0.178.0","body":"Defect fixes:\r\n\r\n- Fixed issue with `jmespath::join function` through PR #546\r\n \r\n- Fixed issue with the path for cmake config files through PR #547\r\n\r\n- Related to #539, made the basic_json constructor `basic_json(const Allocator&)`  \r\nconsistent with `basic_json(json_object_arg_t, const Allocator& alloc = Allocator())`.\r\n\r\n- Related to #539, `basic_json` copy construction now applies allocator traits `select_on_container_copy_construction`\r\nto the allocator obtained from `other`.

The Dart compiler is now the canonical implementation and is actively maintained by the Sass owners.\r\n* Updates the rule APIs to match the API of Google's internal Sass rules so that these rules can then _replace_ the existing Sass rules inside Google. This is largely adding additional attributes to `sass_binary`, excepting the breaking changes listed below.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\nSass binary now supports three new attributes: `include_paths`, `output_dir`, and `output_name`. See the README for more information on these attributes.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* Additional setup in a project's `WORKSPACE` file is now required; see the README for more information.\r\n* The default output filename for `sass_binary` is now based on the `src` filename instead of the name of the rule. For example, if your input `src` file is `material-button.scss`, the default output filename will be `material-button.css`. The name can be customized via the `output_name` attribute.\r\n* While the Dart compiler should match the libsass compiler's behavior, it is possible some minor differences in CSS output may occur."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/releases/7557505","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/releases/7557505/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/releases/7557505/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_sass/releases/tag/0.0.3","id":7557505,"author":{"login":"vladmos","id":223875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/223875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos","html_url":"https://github.com/vladmos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladmos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTc1NTc1MDU=","tag_name":"0.0.3","target_commitish":"master","name":"","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-08-16T13:27:45Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T13:37:33Z","published_at":"2017-08-29T13:37:33Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/tarball/0.0.3","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/zipball/0.0.3","body":"Changes:\r\n\r\n  * Compatibility with future versions of Bazel"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/releases/5412842","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/releases/5412842/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/releases/5412842/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_sass/releases/tag/0.0.2","id":5412842,"author":{"login":"davidzchen","id":5283042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODMwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5283042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen","html_url":"https://github.com/davidzchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTU0MTI4NDI=","tag_name":"0.0.2","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.0.2","draft":false,"immutable":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2017-02-09T19:00:05Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T20:18:23Z","published_at":"2017-02-09T20:18:23Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/tarball/0.0.2","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_sass/zipball/0.0.2","body":"Major changes:\n- Fixes build by providing cfg parameter for executable labels\n- Use Bazel mirror to download external dependencies\n- Update setup instructions\n"}]

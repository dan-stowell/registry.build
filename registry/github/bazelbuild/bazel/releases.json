(2025-03-24)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number. ([#25549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25549))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n* Handle large numeric segments in Bazel module versions ([#25632](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25632))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n* Don't attempt to enable the Security Manager for jdk >= 24 ([#25658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25658))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc5 (2025-03-21)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number. ([#25549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25549))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n* Handle large numeric segments in Bazel module versions ([#25632](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25632))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n* Don't attempt to enable the Security Manager for jdk >= 24 ([#25658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25658))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc4 (2025-03-19)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number. ([#25549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25549))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n* Handle large numeric segments in Bazel module versions ([#25632](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25632))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc3 (2025-03-19)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number. ([#25549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25549))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc2 (2025-03-18)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc1 (2025-03-11)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

(2025-02-25)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Fix building binary launchers on windows with clang-cl ([#25344](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25344))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Fall back to `rctx.name` if `$original_name` is empty ([#25310](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25310))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Restore compatibility with any JDK 23 on Windows ([#25348](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25348))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Rollback of ‘Use digest function matching the checksum in gRPC remote downloader’ ([#25331](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25331))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.1.0...release-8.1.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0 (2025-02-13)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Added conlyopts and cxxopts to objc_library. ([#25022](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25022))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* --experimental_downloader_config now supports the ~ character for the home directory. ([#24978](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24978))\r\n* Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#25191](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25191))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0rc4 (2025-02-11)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Added conlyopts and cxxopts to objc_library. ([#25022](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25022))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* --experimental_downloader_config now supports the ~ character for the home directory. ([#24978](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24978))\r\n* Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#25191](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25191))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0rc3 (2025-02-07)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Added conlyopts and cxxopts to objc_library. ([#25022](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25022))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* --experimental_downloader_config now supports the ~ character for the home directory. ([#24978](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24978))\r\n* Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#25191](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25191))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0rc2 (2025-02-05)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via --host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#25191](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25191))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0rc1 (2025-02-04)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via --host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

8.0 is a major LTS release. It contains new features and backwards incompatible changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Many rules that were bundled with Bazel are now split into their own repositories, as part of the Starlarkification effort. This includes:\r\n  * Android: All android_* build and repo rules have been moved to http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android. Android tools are no longer bundled with Bazel inside @bazel_tools//tools/android.\r\n  * C++: All C++ toolchain-related symbols have been moved http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_cc; other symbols, including the rules themselves, will be moved in a future release.\r\n  * Java: All java_* rules and providers (like JavaInfo)  have been moved to http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java.\r\n  * Protobuf: All *_proto_library rules (for Java, C++, Python)  and providers (like ProtoInfo)  have been moved to http://github.com/google/protobuf.\r\n  * Python: All py_* rules and providers (like PyInfo) have been moved to http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python.\r\n  * Shell: All sh_* rules have been moved to http://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_shell.\r\n  * Use load statements for all  the rules and providers from the above repositories. The load statements work with Bazel 6, 7 and 8 (repositories are backwards compatible and support both bzlmod and WORKSPACE mode). Bazel 9 will make load statements mandatory. \r\n  * To facilitate migration, Bazel 8 introduces the --incompatible_autoload_externally flag, which by default loads rules and symbols that were previously hard-coded inside Bazel from corresponding rule repositories.\r\n* The WORKSPACE mechanism is now disabled by default.\r\n  * [Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/overview#bzlmod), the new way to manage external dependencies, is turned on by default since Bazel 7.0.\r\n  * The WORKSPACE and WORKSPACE.bzlmod files are no longer read by Bazel, by default. To bring back this behavior, use --enable_workspace. Check the [migration guide](https://bazel.build/external/migration) and try out the [migration tool](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry/tree/main/tools#migrate_to_bzlmodpy) for moving your external dependencies to Bzlmod.\r\n  * We are aiming to remove WORKSPACE in Bazel 9 completely.\r\n* Symbolic macros are introduced as a new way to write build macros, improving the experience for both macro authors and BUILD file owners.\r\n  * Symbolic macro arguments are typed like rule attributes, with similar type conversions. They also are less prone to latent bugs because they automatically promote values of configurable attributes to select() expressions.\r\n  * Symbolic macros avoid pitfalls that harm BUILD readability, such as mutating their arguments, and are compatible with lazy evaluation (not implemented yet).\r\n  * Internal targets of symbolic macros are protected from clients by the visibility system.\r\n  * Legacy macros that call native.existing_rules() can often be replaced by finalizer macros.\r\n  * See https://bazel.build/extending/macros for more detail on symbolic macros.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Migration-Ready Incompatible Flags\r\nThe following flags are flipped in 8.0:\r\n* --enable_workspace ([#23023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23023); now defaults to false)\r\n* --incompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools ([#22249](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249); now defaults to true)\r\n* --incompatible_disallow_empty_glob ([#8195](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/8195); now defaults to true)\r\n* --incompatible_macos_set_install_name ([#12370](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12370); now defaults to true)\r\n* --incompatible_no_implicit_watch_label ([#23861](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23861); now defaults to true)\r\n* --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods ([#19465](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19465); now defaults to true)\r\n* --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names ([#23127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23127); now defaults to true)\r\n* --legacy_external_runfiles ([#23574](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23574); now defaults to false)\r\n* --legacy_important_outputs ([#14353](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14353); now defaults to false)\r\n* --zip_undeclared_test_outputs ([489d08b](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/489d08bf472f4568b3f7f478a8747a30cb956111); now defaults to false)\r\n\r\nThe following flags will be flipped in a future major release:\r\n* --incompatible_autoload_externally ([#23043](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23043); will default to true)\r\n* --incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules ([#22080](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22080); will default to true)\r\n* --incompatible_disable_non_executable_java_binary ([#19687](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19687); will default to true)\r\n* --incompatible_disallow_struct_provider_syntax ([#19467](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19467); will default to true)\r\n* --incompatible_disable_target_provider_fields ([#19466](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19466); will default to true)\r\n* --incompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis ([#23144](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23144); will default to false)\r\n* --incompatible_stop_exporting_language_modules ([#19455](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19455); will default to true)\r\n* --incompatible_auto_exec_groups ([#17134](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17134); will default to true)\r\n* --incompatible_disable_starlark_host_transitions ([#17032](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17032); will default to true)\r\n* --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility ([#12933](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933); will default to true)\r\n\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (@@) instead of single-at (@) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The global applicable_licenses attribute has been renamed to package_metadata. The older name may be used for creating targets, but Starlark code must use the name package_metadata to retrieve it.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed. It has been a no-op for several years now. distribs() at the package level is no longer legal syntax.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The path attribute is removed from filegroup.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --zip_undeclared_test_outputs now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to $TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled. ([#24210](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24210))\r\n* The result of canonicalize-flags now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use --noexperimental_include_default_values for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n* Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path ([#23331](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23331)).\r\n* genquery now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage.\r\n* The default value of --skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation and --skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n* Improved progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n* glob now has a more efficient implementation that uses less retained memory and CPU, while sometimes taking more wall time for recursive globs in very large directory trees.\r\n* REPO.bazel now allows another directive, ignore_directories(). It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics. ([#24203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24203))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Native `mobile-install` is deleted. Please use the new Starlarkified version (“mobile-install v3”) instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build Event Protocol\r\n* BEP will include correct TestResult and TargetSummary events when special test inputs like $test_runtime fail to build.\r\n* The default size limit for a named set of files in BEP is now 5000 (was unlimited before). In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n* BEP now contains data similar to dump command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys.\r\n* WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n* BEP's execution_phase_time_in_ms no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in execution_phase_time_in_ms expected.\r\n* A new experimental flag, --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY which populates OutputGroup.file_sets. Users may now specify INLINE_ONLY to instead report files directly in the TargetComplete/AspectComplete event under OutputGroup.inline_files. Users may also specify BOTH to populate OutputGroup.file_sets and OutputGroup.inline_files.\r\n* Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via --zip_undeclared_test_outputs.\r\n* Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n* By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the TargetComplete event. To disable this behavior, pass --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only.\r\n\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed. Use regular cc_toolchain instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, and should_strip_binary in the objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, and objc_should_strip_binary in the cpp fragment instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use @rpath to find their .dylib dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies. ([#23090](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23090))\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The deprecated fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode and fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have the correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a cc_* target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library @rules_cc/cc//runfiles via deps or implementation_deps.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** C++ toolchains configuration files have moved to rules_cc, if you are depending on anything in @bazel_tools//tools/cpp, you should use the version from @rules_cc (>=0.0.12) instead.\r\n* Added conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to C++ rules ([#23792](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23792))\r\n* cc_toolchain now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n* The new cc_static_library rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via --experimental_cc_static_library.\r\n* New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n* --incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is now a no-op.\r\n* --compile_one_dependency selects header-only cc_librarys in more cases.\r\n* Added windows_quoting_for_param_files feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n* The local_defines attribute of cc_library() and cc_binary() supports $(location ...) expansion for additional_compiler_inputs just like for deps.\r\n* The bazel --quiet command line option can now be used to make Bazel emit much less output. ([#24024](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24024))\r\n* **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a [no op](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260). All C++ rules use Bazel's [toolchain API](https://bazel.build/extending/toolchains).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a [no op](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260). All C++ rules use Bazel's [toolchain API](https://bazel.build/extending/toolchains).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configurability / cquery\r\n* **[Incompatible]** [Incoming](https://bazel.build/extending/config#incoming-edge-transitions) rule() transitions  can't set cfg = \"exec\" or [cfg = config.exec()](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/toplevel/config#exec). This generally doesn't make sense. Prefer declaring dependencies as exec tools.\r\n* Starlark rules can annotate attr() with [cfg = config.none()](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/toplevel/config#none). This is useful for pure-data dependencies that should build the same no matter their parent's configuration.\r\n* Starlark rules can replace cfg = \"target\" on attribute definitions with [cfg = config.target()](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/toplevel/config#target) for more consistent syntax.\r\n* [bazel cquery](https://bazel.build/query/cquery) [more accurately](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16310#issuecomment-1876108171) lists dependencies from aspects. Requires --experimental_explicit_aspects. Try this if you see confusing results. As an experimental feature this doesn't work for all output formats. Available since 7.2.0. \r\n* [bazel query](https://bazel.build/query/guide) includes [toolchain type requirements](https://bazel.build/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains#toolchain_type) as implicit dependencies.. This includes the [toolchains](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/globals/bzl.html#rule.toolchains) parameter in rule() definitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Coverage\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators no longer receive the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (+) instead of tilde (~). Effectively, this flips the flag --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\"). ​​See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n* --experimental_repository_downloader_retries now defaults to 5.\r\n* Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with --ignore_dev_dependency. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n* The fetch and vendor commands now support --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n* Patches to the module file in single_version_override are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n* Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n* override_repo and inject_repo can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions. ([#23534](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23534))\r\n* The new --inject_repository flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with --enable_bzlmod. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by local_repository via use_repo_rule in the root module. ([#24301](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24301))\r\n* External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level external directory or package. ([#24147](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24147))\r\n* repository_ctx.execute can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value None in the environment argument. ([#24245](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24245))\r\n* bazel mod now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate. ([#24259](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24259))\r\n* archive_override now accepts all attributes usable with http_archive; similar for git_override and git_repository. ([#24443](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24443))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* The core Java rules (java_binary, java_library, java_test, java_import, java_plugin) and symbols (java_common, JavaInfo, JavaPluginInfo) are no longer available in Bazel and must be loaded from @rules_java. \r\n  * WORKSPACE builds may need to update their setup, see the release notes at https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/releases for what @rules_java now requires. Relatedly, projects enabling both --enable_bzlmod and --enable_workspace that fetch @rules_java via the MODULE.bazel file, may need to explicitly re-declare some dependencies in the WORKSPACE file, as Bzlmod dependencies are not automatically visible to other WORKSPACE repositories.\r\n* The default java language level (with rules_java 8.1.0) is now 11 (previously 8).\r\n* java_binary and java_test no longer generate an additional target - the deploy jars are once again outputs of the primary (only) target.\r\n* JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n* Java compilation actions now set LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 (previously: en_US.UTF-8).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic. ([#24251](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24251))\r\n* Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n* Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the --windows_enable_symlinks flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set --noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The aquery command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the unused_inputs_list argument to ctx.actions.run. Set --noinclude_pruned_inputs to omit pruned inputs from aquery output when running it after action execution.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n* --experimental_collect_system_network_usage is flipped to true and will be removed soon.\r\n* Introduced Skyfocus, an experimental feature aimed to reduce Bazel's retained heap usage with working sets. Use --experimental_enable_skyfocus to enable it. See [documentation](https://bazel.build/advanced/performance/memory#trade-flexibility) for more information. \r\n* bazel query now uses 3% less memory.\r\n* Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n* Added --experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: BZL_LOAD, GLOB, GLOBS, PACKAGE, CONFIGURED_TARGET, ASPECT, ACTION_EXECUTION.\r\n* Introduced a new format for the execution log, enabled by --execution_log_compact_file. This format is preferred over the preexisting --execution_log_{binary,json}_file, as it’s much cheaper to produce and smaller in size; however, it’s not human-readable. The tools in //src/tools/execlog may be used to analyze logs and convert between formats.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Added the ability to garbage collect the disk cache by setting one or both of --experimental_disk_cache_gc_max_size and --experimental_disk_cache_gc_max_age. Garbage collection occurs in the background while the Bazel server is idle; the idle timer defaults to 5 minutes, but may be overridden by --experimental_disk_cache_gc_idle_delay.\r\n* The default value of --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries is changed to 5.\r\n* Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set --noremote_cache_async to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n* Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n* --incompatible_remote_symlinks, --incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks, --incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers and --incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_rootare deleted.\r\n* --build_event_upload_max_threads is removed.\r\n* The default value of --experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold is changed to 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n* Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n* Aspects can now propagate to target’s toolchain dependencies by specifying the toolchain types to propagate to via toolchains_aspects.\r\n* Aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files field is supported.\r\n* Output groups provided by a rule and/or multiple aspects are now merged instead of resulting in an error.\r\n* If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n* Starlark min and max builtins now allow a key callback, similarly to sorted.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain //visibility:public and //visibility:private elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute. ([#19922](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19922))\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs simplifies configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects. ([#19922](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19922))\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The input_manifests argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** ctx.resolve_tools is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. Use --noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools to temporarily make it available again. (#22249)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n* **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to C:/msys64 from C:/tools/msys64.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Appendix\r\nThe following flags have been removed or changed to no-op:\r\n* --android_cpu\r\n* --android_crosstool_top\r\n* --android_grte_top\r\n* --android_sdk\r\n* --crosstool_top\r\n* --enable_fdo_profile_absolute_path\r\n* --experimental_announce_profile_path\r\n* --experimental_objc_include_scanning\r\n* --experimental_proto_extra_actions\r\n* --fat_apk_cpu\r\n* --host_crosstool_top\r\n* --host_swiftcopt\r\n* --incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars\r\n* --incompatible_disallow_symlink_file_to_dir\r\n* --incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs\r\n* --incompatible_enable_android_toolchain_resolution\r\n* --incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution\r\n* --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view\r\n* --incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone\r\n* --incompatible_objc_provider_remove_linking_info\r\n* --incompatible_remote_build_event_upload_respect_no_cache\r\n* --incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks\r\n* --incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers\r\n* --incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root\r\n* --incompatible_remote_results_ignore_disk\r\n* --incompatible_remote_symlinks\r\n* --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n* --incompatible_use_host_features\r\n* --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names\r\n* --python2_path\r\n* --python3_path\r\n* --swiftcopt\r\n \r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements:\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Adam Azarchs, Adam Singer, Alan Falloon, Alessandro Patti, Alex Eagle, Alex Sharoff, Alexander Golovlev, Alexandre Boulgakov, Artem V.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.0.0rc8 (2024-12-06)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  d0285222b0060847d815d87d6757ca22e43ebd93\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ A transition that removes all configuration is now available as `config.none()`. (#24112)\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics. (#24203)\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module. (#24301)\r\n+ Changes the default java language level to 11 (previously 8) (#23920)\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance. (#24445)\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility. (#24035)\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package. (#24147)\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument. (#24245)\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate. (#24259)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference): * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration. * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform. * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see #18265).\r\n+ \"bazel aquery\" now returns the headers C++ compilation actions can include if the --include_scheduling_dependencies command line option is set.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** transition is removed from objc_library (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688)\r\n+ This change will set the default size limit for named set of files in BEP from unlimited to 5000. In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Delete the --experimental_execution_log_file flag. Use --execution_log_binary_file in conjunction with --noexecution_log_sort instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default. See #19915 for migration advice.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Incoming transitions on rules can't be set to \"exec\" transition.\r\n+ The global \"applicable_licenses\" attribute has been renamed to \"package_metadata\". The older name may be used for creating targets, but starlark code must use the name \"package_metadata\" to retrieve it.  Breaking change.\r\n+ WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n+ `--incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars` is a no-op\r\n+ JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n+ The invocation URL in the terminal is now prominently colorized in blue.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n+ `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with `--enable_bzlmod`: 1. root module's module file 2. `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` 3. non-root modules' module files 4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` or execution platforms)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a no-op, enabled by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a no op rule (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits. * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n+ Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n+ Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to True) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off.\r\n+ Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`. * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`. * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.local_target_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n+ The invocation URL is re-colorized to cyan from blue due to readability issues with dark backgrounds.\r\n+ Label.local_target_label is renamed to Label.same_package_label.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** progress messages print short primary input and output without root base\r\n+ Update iOS tutorial link.\r\n+ The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed It has been a no-op for several years now.\r\n+ Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n+ modifies visibility error to be more readable.\r\n+ fixes overly-broad test assertion\r\n+ The deprecated `fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode` and `fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode` APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping)\r\n+ `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching.\r\n+ Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The \"input_manifests\" argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n+ BEP's `execution_phase_time_in_ms` no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in `execution_phase_time_in_ms` expected.\r\n+ The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`.\r\n+ Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n+ The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n+ Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes, Bazel will refetch the repo.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp fragments instead.\r\n+ Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.\r\n+ `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag).\r\n+ The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values` for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n+ Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n+ New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n+ Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable.\r\n+ The `local_repository` and `new_local_repository` repository rules are now available as Starlark rules under `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:local.bzl`. They are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts, and can be used in module extensions.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables\r\n+ incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is a no-op\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Flipped --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n+ Added `bazel dump --skyframe=function_graph` to generate a DOT file representing the relationship between `SkyFunction` implementations in the Bazel skyframe graph.\r\n+ aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior.\r\n+ toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.\r\n+ Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to `C:/msys64` instead of `C:/tools/msys64`.\r\n+ `distribs()` at the package level is no longer legal syntax. It may still be set on individual targets, even though it is a no-op.\r\n+ Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files.\r\n+ `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`).\r\n+ bzlmod `git_repository` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call.\r\n+ BEP now contains data similar to `dump` command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys\r\n+ Delete the native AndroidDevice rule. This follows the deletion of the native AndroidTest and AndroidInstrumentationTest rules.\r\n+ Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets.\r\n+ `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n+ The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event.\r\n+ The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available).\r\n+ The format for MODULE.bazel.lock is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured).\r\n+ The native aar_import is no longer provided in Bazel. See github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n+ The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`.\r\n+ A no-op transition is now available as `config.target()`.\r\n+ The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled.\r\n+ Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`.\r\n+ `cc_toolchain` now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n+ `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n+ Changes to environment variables read via `getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions.\r\n+ `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` is flipped to `true`.\r\n+ Progress is no longer written to BEP after the build completing event is posted.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** path attribute is removed from filegroup\r\n+ Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup.\r\n+ Deleted Bazel's builtin aar_import helper tools. They live in rules_android now.\r\n+ `query` now uses 3% less RAM.\r\n+ `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` defaults to `5`.\r\n+ `genquery` now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage. The default value of `--skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation` and `--skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation` has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n+ Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`.\r\n+ Stop exposing the AndroidPlatformsTransition to Starlark.\r\n+ Added `--experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler` to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: `BZL_LOAD`, `GLOB`, `GLOBS`, `PACKAGE`, `CONFIGURED_TARGET`, `ASPECT`, `ACTION_EXECUTION`.\r\n+ `--compile_one_dependency` selects header-only `cc_library`s in more cases\r\n+ The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (`+`) instead of tilde (`~`). Effectively, this flips the flag `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\").\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_ndk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_local_test rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ BEP will include correct \\`TestResult\\` and \\`TargetSummary\\` events when special test inputs like \\`$test_runtime\\` fail to build.\r\n+ Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n+ aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files= field is supported.\r\n+ The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`.\r\n+ Deleted native Android mobile-install\r\n+ Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n+ A new experimental flag, `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode`, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is `FILESET` which populates `OutputGroup.file_sets`. Users may now specify `INLINE` to instead report files directly in the `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete` event under `OutputGroup.inline_files`. Users may also specify `BOTH` to populate `OutputGroup.file_sets` and `OutputGroup.inline_files`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `ctx.resolve_tools` is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249 for migration instructions. Use `--noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools` to temporarily make it available again.\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_binary, android_library, android_device_script_fixture and android_host_service_fixture rules. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_sdk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is removed.\r\n+ `--build_event_upload_max_threads` is removed.\r\n+ `incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root` is removed.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold` is changed to `100`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `aquery` command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the `unused_inputs_list` argument to `ctx.actions.run`. Set `--noinclude_pruned_inputs` to omit pruned inputs from `aquery` output when running it after action execution. **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the `--windows_enable_symlinks` flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set `--noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n+ By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the `TargetComplete` event. To disable this behavior, pass `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only`.\r\n+ Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set `--noremote_cache_async` to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n+ Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n+ Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs`.\r\n+ Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n+ The native version of android_tools_defaults_jar is no longer in Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n+ The compact execution log now stores runfiles in a more compact representation that should reduce the memory overhead and log output size, in particular for test spawns. This change required breaking changes to the (experimental) log format.\r\n+ `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions.\r\n+ Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n+ If `--allowed_cpu_values` is set, the `--cpu` flag value is validated against it.\r\n+ Native android_sdk is no longer available within Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use `@rpath` to find their `.dylib` dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies.\r\n+ Add the --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs option to simplify configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects; for example, if [\"a\"] + select(\"//conditions:default\", [\"b\"]) is assigned to a rule attribute, it is stored as [\"a\", \"b\"].\r\n+ `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is deleted.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` and `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` are deleted.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is changed to `5`.\r\n+ If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n+ Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain \"//visibility:public\" and \"//visibility:private\" elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute: [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:public\"] is saved as [\"//visibility:public\"], [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:private\"] is saved as [\"//foo:__subpackages__\"], and for consistency's sake, an empty target visibility list [] is saved as [\"//visibility:private\"].\r\n+ Symbolic Macros -- and with them, Finalizers and the new Macro-Aware Visibility model -- are now generally available (`--experimental_enable_first_class_macros` now defaults to true). Trivial `select()` values are automatically unwrapped (`--incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs` now defaults to true).\r\n+ Moved all Bazel Android tool and action code to rules_android.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file. - --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules\r\n+ `@bazel_tools//tools/android` no longer exists. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob` now defaults to true.\r\n+ Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros. (#24280)\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it. (#24336)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic. (#24251)\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`. (#24443)\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output. (#24024)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.0.0rc7 (2024-12-04)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  d0285222b0060847d815d87d6757ca22e43ebd93\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ A transition that removes all configuration is now available as `config.none()`. (#24112)\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics. (#24203)\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module. (#24301)\r\n+ Changes the default java language level to 11 (previously 8) (#23920)\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance. (#24445)\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility. (#24035)\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package. (#24147)\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument. (#24245)\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate. (#24259)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference): * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration. * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform. * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see #18265).\r\n+ \"bazel aquery\" now returns the headers C++ compilation actions can include if the --include_scheduling_dependencies command line option is set.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** transition is removed from objc_library (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688)\r\n+ This change will set the default size limit for named set of files in BEP from unlimited to 5000. In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Delete the --experimental_execution_log_file flag. Use --execution_log_binary_file in conjunction with --noexecution_log_sort instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default. See #19915 for migration advice.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Incoming transitions on rules can't be set to \"exec\" transition.\r\n+ The global \"applicable_licenses\" attribute has been renamed to \"package_metadata\". The older name may be used for creating targets, but starlark code must use the name \"package_metadata\" to retrieve it.  Breaking change.\r\n+ WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n+ `--incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars` is a no-op\r\n+ JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n+ The invocation URL in the terminal is now prominently colorized in blue.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n+ `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with `--enable_bzlmod`: 1. root module's module file 2. `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` 3. non-root modules' module files 4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` or execution platforms)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a no-op, enabled by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a no op rule (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits. * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n+ Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n+ Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to True) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off.\r\n+ Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`. * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`. * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.local_target_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n+ The invocation URL is re-colorized to cyan from blue due to readability issues with dark backgrounds.\r\n+ Label.local_target_label is renamed to Label.same_package_label.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** progress messages print short primary input and output without root base\r\n+ Update iOS tutorial link.\r\n+ The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed It has been a no-op for several years now.\r\n+ Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n+ modifies visibility error to be more readable.\r\n+ fixes overly-broad test assertion\r\n+ The deprecated `fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode` and `fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode` APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping)\r\n+ `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching.\r\n+ Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The \"input_manifests\" argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n+ BEP's `execution_phase_time_in_ms` no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in `execution_phase_time_in_ms` expected.\r\n+ The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`.\r\n+ Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n+ The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n+ Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes, Bazel will refetch the repo.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp fragments instead.\r\n+ Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.\r\n+ `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag).\r\n+ The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values` for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n+ Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n+ New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n+ Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable.\r\n+ The `local_repository` and `new_local_repository` repository rules are now available as Starlark rules under `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:local.bzl`. They are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts, and can be used in module extensions.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables\r\n+ incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is a no-op\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Flipped --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n+ Added `bazel dump --skyframe=function_graph` to generate a DOT file representing the relationship between `SkyFunction` implementations in the Bazel skyframe graph.\r\n+ aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior.\r\n+ toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.\r\n+ Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to `C:/msys64` instead of `C:/tools/msys64`.\r\n+ `distribs()` at the package level is no longer legal syntax. It may still be set on individual targets, even though it is a no-op.\r\n+ Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files.\r\n+ `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`).\r\n+ bzlmod `git_repository` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call.\r\n+ BEP now contains data similar to `dump` command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys\r\n+ Delete the native AndroidDevice rule. This follows the deletion of the native AndroidTest and AndroidInstrumentationTest rules.\r\n+ Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets.\r\n+ `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n+ The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event.\r\n+ The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available).\r\n+ The format for MODULE.bazel.lock is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured).\r\n+ The native aar_import is no longer provided in Bazel. See github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n+ The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`.\r\n+ A no-op transition is now available as `config.target()`.\r\n+ The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled.\r\n+ Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`.\r\n+ `cc_toolchain` now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n+ `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n+ Changes to environment variables read via `getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions.\r\n+ `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` is flipped to `true`.\r\n+ Progress is no longer written to BEP after the build completing event is posted.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** path attribute is removed from filegroup\r\n+ Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup.\r\n+ Deleted Bazel's builtin aar_import helper tools. They live in rules_android now.\r\n+ `query` now uses 3% less RAM.\r\n+ `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` defaults to `5`.\r\n+ `genquery` now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage. The default value of `--skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation` and `--skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation` has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n+ Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`.\r\n+ Stop exposing the AndroidPlatformsTransition to Starlark.\r\n+ Added `--experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler` to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: `BZL_LOAD`, `GLOB`, `GLOBS`, `PACKAGE`, `CONFIGURED_TARGET`, `ASPECT`, `ACTION_EXECUTION`.\r\n+ `--compile_one_dependency` selects header-only `cc_library`s in more cases\r\n+ The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (`+`) instead of tilde (`~`). Effectively, this flips the flag `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\").\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_ndk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_local_test rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ BEP will include correct \\`TestResult\\` and \\`TargetSummary\\` events when special test inputs like \\`$test_runtime\\` fail to build.\r\n+ Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n+ aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files= field is supported.\r\n+ The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`.\r\n+ Deleted native Android mobile-install\r\n+ Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n+ A new experimental flag, `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode`, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is `FILESET` which populates `OutputGroup.file_sets`. Users may now specify `INLINE` to instead report files directly in the `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete` event under `OutputGroup.inline_files`. Users may also specify `BOTH` to populate `OutputGroup.file_sets` and `OutputGroup.inline_files`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `ctx.resolve_tools` is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249 for migration instructions. Use `--noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools` to temporarily make it available again.\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_binary, android_library, android_device_script_fixture and android_host_service_fixture rules. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_sdk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is removed.\r\n+ `--build_event_upload_max_threads` is removed.\r\n+ `incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root` is removed.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold` is changed to `100`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `aquery` command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the `unused_inputs_list` argument to `ctx.actions.run`. Set `--noinclude_pruned_inputs` to omit pruned inputs from `aquery` output when running it after action execution. **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the `--windows_enable_symlinks` flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set `--noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n+ By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the `TargetComplete` event. To disable this behavior, pass `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only`.\r\n+ Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set `--noremote_cache_async` to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n+ Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n+ Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs`.\r\n+ Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n+ The native version of android_tools_defaults_jar is no longer in Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n+ The compact execution log now stores runfiles in a more compact representation that should reduce the memory overhead and log output size, in particular for test spawns. This change required breaking changes to the (experimental) log format.\r\n+ `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions.\r\n+ Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n+ If `--allowed_cpu_values` is set, the `--cpu` flag value is validated against it.\r\n+ Native android_sdk is no longer available within Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use `@rpath` to find their `.dylib` dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies.\r\n+ Add the --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs option to simplify configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects; for example, if [\"a\"] + select(\"//conditions:default\", [\"b\"]) is assigned to a rule attribute, it is stored as [\"a\", \"b\"].\r\n+ `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is deleted.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` and `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` are deleted.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is changed to `5`.\r\n+ If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n+ Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain \"//visibility:public\" and \"//visibility:private\" elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute: [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:public\"] is saved as [\"//visibility:public\"], [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:private\"] is saved as [\"//foo:__subpackages__\"], and for consistency's sake, an empty target visibility list [] is saved as [\"//visibility:private\"].\r\n+ Symbolic Macros -- and with them, Finalizers and the new Macro-Aware Visibility model -- are now generally available (`--experimental_enable_first_class_macros` now defaults to true). Trivial `select()` values are automatically unwrapped (`--incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs` now defaults to true).\r\n+ Moved all Bazel Android tool and action code to rules_android.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file. - --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules\r\n+ `@bazel_tools//tools/android` no longer exists. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob` now defaults to true.\r\n+ Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros. (#24280)\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it. (#24336)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic. (#24251)\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`. (#24443)\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output. (#24024)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.0.0rc6 (2024-11-28)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  d0285222b0060847d815d87d6757ca22e43ebd93\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ A transition that removes all configuration is now available as `config.none()`. (#24112)\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics. (#24203)\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module. (#24301)\r\n+ Changes the default java language level to 11 (previously 8) (#23920)\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance. (#24445)\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility. (#24035)\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package. (#24147)\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument. (#24245)\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate. (#24259)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference): * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration. * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform. * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see #18265).\r\n+ \"bazel aquery\" now returns the headers C++ compilation actions can include if the --include_scheduling_dependencies command line option is set.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** transition is removed from objc_library (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688)\r\n+ This change will set the default size limit for named set of files in BEP from unlimited to 5000. In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Delete the --experimental_execution_log_file flag. Use --execution_log_binary_file in conjunction with --noexecution_log_sort instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default. See #19915 for migration advice.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Incoming transitions on rules can't be set to \"exec\" transition.\r\n+ The global \"applicable_licenses\" attribute has been renamed to \"package_metadata\". The older name may be used for creating targets, but starlark code must use the name \"package_metadata\" to retrieve it.  Breaking change.\r\n+ WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n+ `--incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars` is a no-op\r\n+ JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n+ The invocation URL in the terminal is now prominently colorized in blue.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n+ `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with `--enable_bzlmod`: 1. root module's module file 2. `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` 3. non-root modules' module files 4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` or execution platforms)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a no-op, enabled by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a no op rule (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits. * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n+ Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n+ Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to True) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off.\r\n+ Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`. * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`. * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.local_target_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n+ The invocation URL is re-colorized to cyan from blue due to readability issues with dark backgrounds.\r\n+ Label.local_target_label is renamed to Label.same_package_label.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** progress messages print short primary input and output without root base\r\n+ Update iOS tutorial link.\r\n+ The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed It has been a no-op for several years now.\r\n+ Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n+ modifies visibility error to be more readable.\r\n+ fixes overly-broad test assertion\r\n+ The deprecated `fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode` and `fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode` APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping)\r\n+ `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching.\r\n+ Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The \"input_manifests\" argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n+ BEP's `execution_phase_time_in_ms` no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in `execution_phase_time_in_ms` expected.\r\n+ The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`.\r\n+ Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n+ The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n+ Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes, Bazel will refetch the repo.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp fragments instead.\r\n+ Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.\r\n+ `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag).\r\n+ The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values` for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n+ Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n+ New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n+ Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable.\r\n+ The `local_repository` and `new_local_repository` repository rules are now available as Starlark rules under `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:local.bzl`. They are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts, and can be used in module extensions.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables\r\n+ incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is a no-op\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Flipped --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n+ Added `bazel dump --skyframe=function_graph` to generate a DOT file representing the relationship between `SkyFunction` implementations in the Bazel skyframe graph.\r\n+ aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior.\r\n+ toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.\r\n+ Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to `C:/msys64` instead of `C:/tools/msys64`.\r\n+ `distribs()` at the package level is no longer legal syntax. It may still be set on individual targets, even though it is a no-op.\r\n+ Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files.\r\n+ `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`).\r\n+ bzlmod `git_repository` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call.\r\n+ BEP now contains data similar to `dump` command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys\r\n+ Delete the native AndroidDevice rule. This follows the deletion of the native AndroidTest and AndroidInstrumentationTest rules.\r\n+ Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets.\r\n+ `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n+ The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event.\r\n+ The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available).\r\n+ The format for MODULE.bazel.lock is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured).\r\n+ The native aar_import is no longer provided in Bazel. See github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n+ The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`.\r\n+ A no-op transition is now available as `config.target()`.\r\n+ The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled.\r\n+ Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`.\r\n+ `cc_toolchain` now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n+ `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n+ Changes to environment variables read via `getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions.\r\n+ `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` is flipped to `true`.\r\n+ Progress is no longer written to BEP after the build completing event is posted.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** path attribute is removed from filegroup\r\n+ Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup.\r\n+ Deleted Bazel's builtin aar_import helper tools. They live in rules_android now.\r\n+ `query` now uses 3% less RAM.\r\n+ `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` defaults to `5`.\r\n+ `genquery` now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage. The default value of `--skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation` and `--skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation` has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n+ Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`.\r\n+ Stop exposing the AndroidPlatformsTransition to Starlark.\r\n+ Added `--experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler` to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: `BZL_LOAD`, `GLOB`, `GLOBS`, `PACKAGE`, `CONFIGURED_TARGET`, `ASPECT`, `ACTION_EXECUTION`.\r\n+ `--compile_one_dependency` selects header-only `cc_library`s in more cases\r\n+ The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (`+`) instead of tilde (`~`). Effectively, this flips the flag `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\").\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_ndk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_local_test rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ BEP will include correct \\`TestResult\\` and \\`TargetSummary\\` events when special test inputs like \\`$test_runtime\\` fail to build.\r\n+ Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n+ aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files= field is supported.\r\n+ The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`.\r\n+ Deleted native Android mobile-install\r\n+ Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n+ A new experimental flag, `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode`, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is `FILESET` which populates `OutputGroup.file_sets`. Users may now specify `INLINE` to instead report files directly in the `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete` event under `OutputGroup.inline_files`. Users may also specify `BOTH` to populate `OutputGroup.file_sets` and `OutputGroup.inline_files`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `ctx.resolve_tools` is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249 for migration instructions. Use `--noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools` to temporarily make it available again.\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_binary, android_library, android_device_script_fixture and android_host_service_fixture rules. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_sdk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is removed.\r\n+ `--build_event_upload_max_threads` is removed.\r\n+ `incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root` is removed.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold` is changed to `100`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `aquery` command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the `unused_inputs_list` argument to `ctx.actions.run`. Set `--noinclude_pruned_inputs` to omit pruned inputs from `aquery` output when running it after action execution. **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the `--windows_enable_symlinks` flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set `--noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n+ By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the `TargetComplete` event. To disable this behavior, pass `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only`.\r\n+ Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set `--noremote_cache_async` to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n+ Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n+ Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs`.\r\n+ Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n+ The native version of android_tools_defaults_jar is no longer in Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n+ The compact execution log now stores runfiles in a more compact representation that should reduce the memory overhead and log output size, in particular for test spawns. This change required breaking changes to the (experimental) log format.\r\n+ `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions.\r\n+ Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n+ If `--allowed_cpu_values` is set, the `--cpu` flag value is validated against it.\r\n+ Native android_sdk is no longer available within Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use `@rpath` to find their `.dylib` dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies.\r\n+ Add the --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs option to simplify configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects; for example, if [\"a\"] + select(\"//conditions:default\", [\"b\"]) is assigned to a rule attribute, it is stored as [\"a\", \"b\"].\r\n+ `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is deleted.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` and `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` are deleted.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is changed to `5`.\r\n+ If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n+ Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain \"//visibility:public\" and \"//visibility:private\" elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute: [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:public\"] is saved as [\"//visibility:public\"], [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:private\"] is saved as [\"//foo:__subpackages__\"], and for consistency's sake, an empty target visibility list [] is saved as [\"//visibility:private\"].\r\n+ Symbolic Macros -- and with them, Finalizers and the new Macro-Aware Visibility model -- are now generally available (`--experimental_enable_first_class_macros` now defaults to true). Trivial `select()` values are automatically unwrapped (`--incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs` now defaults to true).\r\n+ Moved all Bazel Android tool and action code to rules_android.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file. - --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules\r\n+ `@bazel_tools//tools/android` no longer exists. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob` now defaults to true.\r\n+ Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros. (#24280)\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it. (#24336)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic. (#24251)\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`. (#24443)\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output. (#24024)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.0.0rc5 (2024-11-28)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  d0285222b0060847d815d87d6757ca22e43ebd93\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ A transition that removes all configuration is now available as `config.none()`. (#24112)\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics. (#24203)\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module. (#24301)\r\n+ Changes the default java language level to 11 (previously 8) (#23920)\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance. (#24445)\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility. (#24035)\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package. (#24147)\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument. (#24245)\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate. (#24259)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference): * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration. * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform. * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see #18265).\r\n+ \"bazel aquery\" now returns the headers C++ compilation actions can include if the --include_scheduling_dependencies command line option is set.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** transition is removed from objc_library (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688)\r\n+ This change will set the default size limit for named set of files in BEP from unlimited to 5000. In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Delete the --experimental_execution_log_file flag. Use --execution_log_binary_file in conjunction with --noexecution_log_sort instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default. See #19915 for migration advice.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Incoming transitions on rules can't be set to \"exec\" transition.\r\n+ The global \"applicable_licenses\" attribute has been renamed to \"package_metadata\". The older name may be used for creating targets, but starlark code must use the name \"package_metadata\" to retrieve it.  Breaking change.\r\n+ WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n+ `--incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars` is a no-op\r\n+ JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n+ The invocation URL in the terminal is now prominently colorized in blue.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n+ `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with `--enable_bzlmod`: 1. root module's module file 2. `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` 3. non-root modules' module files 4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` or execution platforms)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a no-op, enabled by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a no op rule (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits. * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n+ Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n+ Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to True) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off.\r\n+ Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`. * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`. * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.local_target_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n+ The invocation URL is re-colorized to cyan from blue due to readability issues with dark backgrounds.\r\n+ Label.local_target_label is renamed to Label.same_package_label.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** progress messages print short primary input and output without root base\r\n+ Update iOS tutorial link.\r\n+ The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed It has been a no-op for several years now.\r\n+ Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n+ modifies visibility error to be more readable.\r\n+ fixes overly-broad test assertion\r\n+ The deprecated `fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode` and `fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode` APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping)\r\n+ `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching.\r\n+ Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The \"input_manifests\" argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n+ BEP's `execution_phase_time_in_ms` no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in `execution_phase_time_in_ms` expected.\r\n+ The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`.\r\n+ Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n+ The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n+ Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes, Bazel will refetch the repo.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp fragments instead.\r\n+ Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.\r\n+ `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag).\r\n+ The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values` for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n+ Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n+ New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n+ Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable.\r\n+ The `local_repository` and `new_local_repository` repository rules are now available as Starlark rules under `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:local.bzl`. They are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts, and can be used in module extensions.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables\r\n+ incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is a no-op\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Flipped --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n+ Added `bazel dump --skyframe=function_graph` to generate a DOT file representing the relationship between `SkyFunction` implementations in the Bazel skyframe graph.\r\n+ aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior.\r\n+ toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.\r\n+ Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to `C:/msys64` instead of `C:/tools/msys64`.\r\n+ `distribs()` at the package level is no longer legal syntax. It may still be set on individual targets, even though it is a no-op.\r\n+ Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files.\r\n+ `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`).\r\n+ bzlmod `git_repository` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call.\r\n+ BEP now contains data similar to `dump` command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys\r\n+ Delete the native AndroidDevice rule. This follows the deletion of the native AndroidTest and AndroidInstrumentationTest rules.\r\n+ Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets.\r\n+ `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n+ The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event.\r\n+ The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available).\r\n+ The format for MODULE.bazel.lock is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured).\r\n+ The native aar_import is no longer provided in Bazel. See github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n+ The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`.\r\n+ A no-op transition is now available as `config.target()`.\r\n+ The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled.\r\n+ Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`.\r\n+ `cc_toolchain` now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n+ `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n+ Changes to environment variables read via `getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions.\r\n+ `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` is flipped to `true`.\r\n+ Progress is no longer written to BEP after the build completing event is posted.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** path attribute is removed from filegroup\r\n+ Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup.\r\n+ Deleted Bazel's builtin aar_import helper tools. They live in rules_android now.\r\n+ `query` now uses 3% less RAM.\r\n+ `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` defaults to `5`.\r\n+ `genquery` now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage. The default value of `--skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation` and `--skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation` has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n+ Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`.\r\n+ Stop exposing the AndroidPlatformsTransition to Starlark.\r\n+ Added `--experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler` to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: `BZL_LOAD`, `GLOB`, `GLOBS`, `PACKAGE`, `CONFIGURED_TARGET`, `ASPECT`, `ACTION_EXECUTION`.\r\n+ `--compile_one_dependency` selects header-only `cc_library`s in more cases\r\n+ The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (`+`) instead of tilde (`~`). Effectively, this flips the flag `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\").\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_ndk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_local_test rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ BEP will include correct \\`TestResult\\` and \\`TargetSummary\\` events when special test inputs like \\`$test_runtime\\` fail to build.\r\n+ Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n+ aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files= field is supported.\r\n+ The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`.\r\n+ Deleted native Android mobile-install\r\n+ Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n+ A new experimental flag, `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode`, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is `FILESET` which populates `OutputGroup.file_sets`. Users may now specify `INLINE` to instead report files directly in the `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete` event under `OutputGroup.inline_files`. Users may also specify `BOTH` to populate `OutputGroup.file_sets` and `OutputGroup.inline_files`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `ctx.resolve_tools` is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249 for migration instructions. Use `--noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools` to temporarily make it available again.\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_binary, android_library, android_device_script_fixture and android_host_service_fixture rules. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_sdk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is removed.\r\n+ `--build_event_upload_max_threads` is removed.\r\n+ `incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root` is removed.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold` is changed to `100`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `aquery` command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the `unused_inputs_list` argument to `ctx.actions.run`. Set `--noinclude_pruned_inputs` to omit pruned inputs from `aquery` output when running it after action execution. **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the `--windows_enable_symlinks` flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set `--noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n+ By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the `TargetComplete` event. To disable this behavior, pass `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only`.\r\n+ Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set `--noremote_cache_async` to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n+ Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n+ Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs`.\r\n+ Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n+ The native version of android_tools_defaults_jar is no longer in Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n+ The compact execution log now stores runfiles in a more compact representation that should reduce the memory overhead and log output size, in particular for test spawns. This change required breaking changes to the (experimental) log format.\r\n+ `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions.\r\n+ Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n+ If `--allowed_cpu_values` is set, the `--cpu` flag value is validated against it.\r\n+ Native android_sdk is no longer available within Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use `@rpath` to find their `.dylib` dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies.\r\n+ Add the --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs option to simplify configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects; for example, if [\"a\"] + select(\"//conditions:default\", [\"b\"]) is assigned to a rule attribute, it is stored as [\"a\", \"b\"].\r\n+ `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is deleted.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` and `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` are deleted.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is changed to `5`.\r\n+ If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n+ Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain \"//visibility:public\" and \"//visibility:private\" elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute: [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:public\"] is saved as [\"//visibility:public\"], [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:private\"] is saved as [\"//foo:__subpackages__\"], and for consistency's sake, an empty target visibility list [] is saved as [\"//visibility:private\"].\r\n+ Symbolic Macros -- and with them, Finalizers and the new Macro-Aware Visibility model -- are now generally available (`--experimental_enable_first_class_macros` now defaults to true). Trivial `select()` values are automatically unwrapped (`--incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs` now defaults to true).\r\n+ Moved all Bazel Android tool and action code to rules_android.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file. - --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules\r\n+ `@bazel_tools//tools/android` no longer exists. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob` now defaults to true.\r\n+ Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros. (#24280)\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it. (#24336)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic. (#24251)\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`. (#24443)\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output. (#24024)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.0.0rc4 (2024-11-25)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  d0285222b0060847d815d87d6757ca22e43ebd93\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ A transition that removes all configuration is now available as `config.none()`. (#24112)\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics. (#24203)\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module. (#24301)\r\n+ Changes the default java language level to 11 (previously 8) (#23920)\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance. (#24445)\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility. (#24035)\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package. (#24147)\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument. (#24245)\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate. (#24259)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference): * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration. * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform. * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see #18265).\r\n+ \"bazel aquery\" now returns the headers C++ compilation actions can include if the --include_scheduling_dependencies command line option is set.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** transition is removed from objc_library (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688)\r\n+ This change will set the default size limit for named set of files in BEP from unlimited to 5000. In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Delete the --experimental_execution_log_file flag. Use --execution_log_binary_file in conjunction with --noexecution_log_sort instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default. See #19915 for migration advice.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Incoming transitions on rules can't be set to \"exec\" transition.\r\n+ The global \"applicable_licenses\" attribute has been renamed to \"package_metadata\". The older name may be used for creating targets, but starlark code must use the name \"package_metadata\" to retrieve it.  Breaking change.\r\n+ WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n+ `--incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars` is a no-op\r\n+ JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n+ The invocation URL in the terminal is now prominently colorized in blue.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n+ `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with `--enable_bzlmod`: 1. root module's module file 2. `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` 3. non-root modules' module files 4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` or execution platforms)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a no-op, enabled by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a no op rule (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits. * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n+ Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n+ Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to True) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off.\r\n+ Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`. * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`. * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.local_target_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n+ The invocation URL is re-colorized to cyan from blue due to readability issues with dark backgrounds.\r\n+ Label.local_target_label is renamed to Label.same_package_label.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** progress messages print short primary input and output without root base\r\n+ Update iOS tutorial link.\r\n+ The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed It has been a no-op for several years now.\r\n+ Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n+ modifies visibility error to be more readable.\r\n+ fixes overly-broad test assertion\r\n+ The deprecated `fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode` and `fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode` APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping)\r\n+ `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching.\r\n+ Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The \"input_manifests\" argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n+ BEP's `execution_phase_time_in_ms` no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in `execution_phase_time_in_ms` expected.\r\n+ The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`.\r\n+ Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n+ The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n+ Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes, Bazel will refetch the repo.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp fragments instead.\r\n+ Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.\r\n+ `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag).\r\n+ The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values` for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n+ Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n+ New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n+ Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable.\r\n+ The `local_repository` and `new_local_repository` repository rules are now available as Starlark rules under `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:local.bzl`. They are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts, and can be used in module extensions.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables\r\n+ incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is a no-op\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Flipped --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n+ Added `bazel dump --skyframe=function_graph` to generate a DOT file representing the relationship between `SkyFunction` implementations in the Bazel skyframe graph.\r\n+ aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior.\r\n+ toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.\r\n+ Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to `C:/msys64` instead of `C:/tools/msys64`.\r\n+ `distribs()` at the package level is no longer legal syntax. It may still be set on individual targets, even though it is a no-op.\r\n+ Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files.\r\n+ `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`).\r\n+ bzlmod `git_repository` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call.\r\n+ BEP now contains data similar to `dump` command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys\r\n+ Delete the native AndroidDevice rule. This follows the deletion of the native AndroidTest and AndroidInstrumentationTest rules.\r\n+ Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets.\r\n+ `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n+ The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event.\r\n+ The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available).\r\n+ The format for MODULE.bazel.lock is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured).\r\n+ The native aar_import is no longer provided in Bazel. See github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n+ The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`.\r\n+ A no-op transition is now available as `config.target()`.\r\n+ The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled.\r\n+ Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`.\r\n+ `cc_toolchain` now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n+ `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n+ Changes to environment variables read via `getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions.\r\n+ `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` is flipped to `true`.\r\n+ Progress is no longer written to BEP after the build completing event is posted.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** path attribute is removed from filegroup\r\n+ Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup.\r\n+ Deleted Bazel's builtin aar_import helper tools. They live in rules_android now.\r\n+ `query` now uses 3% less RAM.\r\n+ `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` defaults to `5`.\r\n+ `genquery` now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage. The default value of `--skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation` and `--skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation` has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n+ Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`.\r\n+ Stop exposing the AndroidPlatformsTransition to Starlark.\r\n+ Added `--experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler` to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: `BZL_LOAD`, `GLOB`, `GLOBS`, `PACKAGE`, `CONFIGURED_TARGET`, `ASPECT`, `ACTION_EXECUTION`.\r\n+ `--compile_one_dependency` selects header-only `cc_library`s in more cases\r\n+ The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (`+`) instead of tilde (`~`). Effectively, this flips the flag `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\").\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_ndk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_local_test rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ BEP will include correct \\`TestResult\\` and \\`TargetSummary\\` events when special test inputs like \\`$test_runtime\\` fail to build.\r\n+ Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n+ aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files= field is supported.\r\n+ The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`.\r\n+ Deleted native Android mobile-install\r\n+ Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n+ A new experimental flag, `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode`, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is `FILESET` which populates `OutputGroup.file_sets`. Users may now specify `INLINE` to instead report files directly in the `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete` event under `OutputGroup.inline_files`. Users may also specify `BOTH` to populate `OutputGroup.file_sets` and `OutputGroup.inline_files`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `ctx.resolve_tools` is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249 for migration instructions. Use `--noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools` to temporarily make it available again.\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_binary, android_library, android_device_script_fixture and android_host_service_fixture rules. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_sdk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is removed.\r\n+ `--build_event_upload_max_threads` is removed.\r\n+ `incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root` is removed.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold` is changed to `100`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `aquery` command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the `unused_inputs_list` argument to `ctx.actions.run`. Set `--noinclude_pruned_inputs` to omit pruned inputs from `aquery` output when running it after action execution. **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the `--windows_enable_symlinks` flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set `--noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n+ By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the `TargetComplete` event. To disable this behavior, pass `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only`.\r\n+ Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set `--noremote_cache_async` to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n+ Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n+ Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs`.\r\n+ Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n+ The native version of android_tools_defaults_jar is no longer in Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n+ The compact execution log now stores runfiles in a more compact representation that should reduce the memory overhead and log output size, in particular for test spawns. This change required breaking changes to the (experimental) log format.\r\n+ `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions.\r\n+ Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n+ If `--allowed_cpu_values` is set, the `--cpu` flag value is validated against it.\r\n+ Native android_sdk is no longer available within Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use `@rpath` to find their `.dylib` dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies.\r\n+ Add the --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs option to simplify configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects; for example, if [\"a\"] + select(\"//conditions:default\", [\"b\"]) is assigned to a rule attribute, it is stored as [\"a\", \"b\"].\r\n+ `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is deleted.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` and `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` are deleted.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is changed to `5`.\r\n+ If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n+ Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain \"//visibility:public\" and \"//visibility:private\" elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute: [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:public\"] is saved as [\"//visibility:public\"], [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:private\"] is saved as [\"//foo:__subpackages__\"], and for consistency's sake, an empty target visibility list [] is saved as [\"//visibility:private\"].\r\n+ Symbolic Macros -- and with them, Finalizers and the new Macro-Aware Visibility model -- are now generally available (`--experimental_enable_first_class_macros` now defaults to true). Trivial `select()` values are automatically unwrapped (`--incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs` now defaults to true).\r\n+ Moved all Bazel Android tool and action code to rules_android.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file. - --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules\r\n+ `@bazel_tools//tools/android` no longer exists. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob` now defaults to true.\r\n+ Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros. (#24280)\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it. (#24336)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic. (#24251)\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`. (#24443)\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output. (#24024)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.0.0rc3 (2024-11-22)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  d0285222b0060847d815d87d6757ca22e43ebd93\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ A transition that removes all configuration is now available as `config.none()`. (#24112)\r\n+ REPO.bazel now allows another directive, \"ignore_directories()\". It takes a list of directories to ignore just like .bazelignore does, but with glob semantics. (#24203)\r\n+ The new `--inject_repository` flag can be used to add new repositories via the CLI with `--enable_bzlmod`. Such repositories behave as if they were declared by `local_repository` via `use_repo_rule` in the root module. (#24301)\r\n+ Changes the default java language level to 11 (previously 8) (#23920)\r\n+ Re-enable symbolic macro attribute inheritance. (#24445)\r\n+ The stripPrefix parameter of repository_ctx.download_and_extract() and repository_ctx.extract() has been renamed to strip_prefix; the deprecated stripPrefix name remains usable for compatibility. (#24035)\r\n+ External repositories that are managed by Bzlmod can now contain a top-level `external` directory or package. (#24147)\r\n+ `repository_ctx.execute` can now remove an environment variable when executing a process by associating it with the value `None` in the `environment` argument. (#24245)\r\n+ `bazel mod` now tries to evaluate all module extensions, even when some have failed to evaluate. (#24259)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference): * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration. * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform. * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see #18265).\r\n+ \"bazel aquery\" now returns the headers C++ compilation actions can include if the --include_scheduling_dependencies command line option is set.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** transition is removed from objc_library (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688)\r\n+ This change will set the default size limit for named set of files in BEP from unlimited to 5000. In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Delete the --experimental_execution_log_file flag. Use --execution_log_binary_file in conjunction with --noexecution_log_sort instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default. See #19915 for migration advice.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Incoming transitions on rules can't be set to \"exec\" transition.\r\n+ The global \"applicable_licenses\" attribute has been renamed to \"package_metadata\". The older name may be used for creating targets, but starlark code must use the name \"package_metadata\" to retrieve it.  Breaking change.\r\n+ WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n+ `--incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars` is a no-op\r\n+ JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n+ The invocation URL in the terminal is now prominently colorized in blue.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n+ `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with `--enable_bzlmod`: 1. root module's module file 2. `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` 3. non-root modules' module files 4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` or execution platforms)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a no-op, enabled by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a no op rule (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits. * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n+ Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n+ Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to True) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off.\r\n+ Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`. * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`. * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.local_target_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n+ The invocation URL is re-colorized to cyan from blue due to readability issues with dark backgrounds.\r\n+ Label.local_target_label is renamed to Label.same_package_label.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** progress messages print short primary input and output without root base\r\n+ Update iOS tutorial link.\r\n+ The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed It has been a no-op for several years now.\r\n+ Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n+ modifies visibility error to be more readable.\r\n+ fixes overly-broad test assertion\r\n+ The deprecated `fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode` and `fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode` APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping)\r\n+ `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching.\r\n+ Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The \"input_manifests\" argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n+ BEP's `execution_phase_time_in_ms` no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in `execution_phase_time_in_ms` expected.\r\n+ The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`.\r\n+ Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n+ The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n+ Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes, Bazel will refetch the repo.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp fragments instead.\r\n+ Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.\r\n+ `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag).\r\n+ The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values` for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n+ Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n+ New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n+ Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable.\r\n+ The `local_repository` and `new_local_repository` repository rules are now available as Starlark rules under `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:local.bzl`. They are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts, and can be used in module extensions.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables\r\n+ incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is a no-op\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Flipped --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n+ Added `bazel dump --skyframe=function_graph` to generate a DOT file representing the relationship between `SkyFunction` implementations in the Bazel skyframe graph.\r\n+ aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior.\r\n+ toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.\r\n+ Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to `C:/msys64` instead of `C:/tools/msys64`.\r\n+ `distribs()` at the package level is no longer legal syntax. It may still be set on individual targets, even though it is a no-op.\r\n+ Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files.\r\n+ `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`).\r\n+ bzlmod `git_repository` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call.\r\n+ BEP now contains data similar to `dump` command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys\r\n+ Delete the native AndroidDevice rule. This follows the deletion of the native AndroidTest and AndroidInstrumentationTest rules.\r\n+ Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets.\r\n+ `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n+ The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event.\r\n+ The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available).\r\n+ The format for MODULE.bazel.lock is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured).\r\n+ The native aar_import is no longer provided in Bazel. See github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n+ The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`.\r\n+ A no-op transition is now available as `config.target()`.\r\n+ The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled.\r\n+ Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`.\r\n+ `cc_toolchain` now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n+ `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n+ Changes to environment variables read via `getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions.\r\n+ `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` is flipped to `true`.\r\n+ Progress is no longer written to BEP after the build completing event is posted.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** path attribute is removed from filegroup\r\n+ Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup.\r\n+ Deleted Bazel's builtin aar_import helper tools. They live in rules_android now.\r\n+ `query` now uses 3% less RAM.\r\n+ `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` defaults to `5`.\r\n+ `genquery` now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage. The default value of `--skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation` and `--skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation` has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n+ Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`.\r\n+ Stop exposing the AndroidPlatformsTransition to Starlark.\r\n+ Added `--experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler` to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: `BZL_LOAD`, `GLOB`, `GLOBS`, `PACKAGE`, `CONFIGURED_TARGET`, `ASPECT`, `ACTION_EXECUTION`.\r\n+ `--compile_one_dependency` selects header-only `cc_library`s in more cases\r\n+ The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (`+`) instead of tilde (`~`). Effectively, this flips the flag `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\").\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_ndk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_local_test rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ BEP will include correct \\`TestResult\\` and \\`TargetSummary\\` events when special test inputs like \\`$test_runtime\\` fail to build.\r\n+ Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n+ aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files= field is supported.\r\n+ The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`.\r\n+ Deleted native Android mobile-install\r\n+ Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n+ A new experimental flag, `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode`, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is `FILESET` which populates `OutputGroup.file_sets`. Users may now specify `INLINE` to instead report files directly in the `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete` event under `OutputGroup.inline_files`. Users may also specify `BOTH` to populate `OutputGroup.file_sets` and `OutputGroup.inline_files`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `ctx.resolve_tools` is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249 for migration instructions. Use `--noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools` to temporarily make it available again.\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_binary, android_library, android_device_script_fixture and android_host_service_fixture rules. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_sdk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is removed.\r\n+ `--build_event_upload_max_threads` is removed.\r\n+ `incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root` is removed.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold` is changed to `100`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `aquery` command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the `unused_inputs_list` argument to `ctx.actions.run`. Set `--noinclude_pruned_inputs` to omit pruned inputs from `aquery` output when running it after action execution. **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the `--windows_enable_symlinks` flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set `--noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n+ By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the `TargetComplete` event. To disable this behavior, pass `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only`.\r\n+ Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set `--noremote_cache_async` to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n+ Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n+ Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs`.\r\n+ Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n+ The native version of android_tools_defaults_jar is no longer in Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n+ The compact execution log now stores runfiles in a more compact representation that should reduce the memory overhead and log output size, in particular for test spawns. This change required breaking changes to the (experimental) log format.\r\n+ `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions.\r\n+ Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n+ If `--allowed_cpu_values` is set, the `--cpu` flag value is validated against it.\r\n+ Native android_sdk is no longer available within Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use `@rpath` to find their `.dylib` dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies.\r\n+ Add the --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs option to simplify configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects; for example, if [\"a\"] + select(\"//conditions:default\", [\"b\"]) is assigned to a rule attribute, it is stored as [\"a\", \"b\"].\r\n+ `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is deleted.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` and `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` are deleted.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is changed to `5`.\r\n+ If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n+ Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain \"//visibility:public\" and \"//visibility:private\" elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute: [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:public\"] is saved as [\"//visibility:public\"], [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:private\"] is saved as [\"//foo:__subpackages__\"], and for consistency's sake, an empty target visibility list [] is saved as [\"//visibility:private\"].\r\n+ Symbolic Macros -- and with them, Finalizers and the new Macro-Aware Visibility model -- are now generally available (`--experimental_enable_first_class_macros` now defaults to true). Trivial `select()` values are automatically unwrapped (`--incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs` now defaults to true).\r\n+ Moved all Bazel Android tool and action code to rules_android.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file. - --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules\r\n+ `@bazel_tools//tools/android` no longer exists. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob` now defaults to true.\r\n+ Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path.\r\n+ Add inherit_attrs param to macro() to allow symbolic macros to inherit attributes from rules or other symbolic macros. (#24280)\r\n+ symbolic macro attribute inheritance is now marked experimental; set --experimental_enable_macro_inherit_attrs flag to enable it. (#24336)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The mnemonic passed to --worker_extra_flag is now matched against the worker key mnemonic when one is available, instead of the action mnemonic. This makes it consistent with other worker flags taking a mnemonic. (#24251)\r\n+ `archive_override` now accepts all attributes usable with `http_archive`; similar for `git_override` and `git_repository`. (#24443)\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output. (#24024)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, a change to the output base locking protocol might cause an older Bazel invoked immediately after a newer Bazel (on the same output base) to error out instead of blocking for the lock, even if --block_for_lock is enabled.

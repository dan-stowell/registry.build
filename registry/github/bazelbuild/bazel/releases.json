[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.4.0rc1 (2025-08-20)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel releases that include a bundled JDK now use the system trust store for certificates by default. Set `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore` and `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType` via `--host_jvm_args` to override the default location. (#26681)\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Add better defaults for mobile-install flags ([#26388](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26388))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on MacOS now respects XDG directory settings: if the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable is set, the output root directory is ${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/bazel, like on Linux ([#26773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26773))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Added `--incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest`, which causes the repo mapping manifest file for runfiles to use a more compact format when necessary. ([#26420](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26420))\r\n* If a cc toolchain feature named `shorten_virtual_includes` is enabled, virtual include header files are linked under `bin/_virtual_includes/<hash of target path>` instead of `bin/<target package path>/_virtual_includes/<target name>`. This shortens the virtual include paths which is critical for mitigating the long path issue with MSVC on Windows. ([#26532](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26532))\r\n* The `--experimental_cancel_concurrent_tests` option now accepts the values `on_passed`, `on_failed` and `never` and cancels concurrent test runs on the first matching result. If enabled, it's now effective by default and no longer requires `--test_strategy=standalone` to be passed explicitly. ([#26670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26670))\r\n* Tool paths specified in `cc_toolchain` action configs are now normalized based on the current execution platform's OS rather than the host OS. In particular, Windows-style absolute paths are now treated as absolute paths when building on a Windows executor from a non-Windows host. ([#26598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26598))\r\n\r\n## Coverage\r\n* Branches will always be merged as best as possible based on branch and block numbers during coverage report generation. ([#26461](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26461))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Modules backed by `http_archive` or `git_repository` no longer require a MODULE.bazel file to be contained in the source archive. ([#26462](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26462))\r\n* Repository content cache is disabled by default due to [#26450](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/26450), you can still manually enable it by setting --repo_contents_cache=<path>.\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.3.1...release-8.4.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Sky, Adrian Vogelsgesang, Dmitry Ryabkov, Ed Schouten, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Greg, James Judd, Jonathan Woodbury, Keith Smiley, Pelikan.B, Valentin Grigorev, Wade Carpenter, and Xavier Bonaventura.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.3.1 (2025-06-30)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Removed the \"overwrote runfiles\" warning related to rules_shell. ([#26374](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26374))\r\n* Reverted the change to move the Bash runfiles library out of Bazel. This will be delayed until 9.0. ([#26372](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26372))\r\n* Fixed hang with force fetching + repo contents cache ([#26412](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26412))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.3.0...release-8.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.3.1rc2 (2025-06-27)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Removed the \"overwrote runfiles\" warning related to rules_shell. ([#26374](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26374))\r\n* Reverted the change to move the Bash runfiles library out of Bazel. This will be delayed until 9.0. ([#26372](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26372))\r\n* Fixed hang with force fetching + repo contents cache ([#26412](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26412))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.3.0...release-8.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.3.1rc1 (2025-06-25)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Removed the \"overwrote runfiles\" warning related to rules_shell. ([#26374](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26374))\r\n* Reverted the change to move the Bash runfiles library out of Bazel. This will be delayed until 9.0. ([#26372](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26372))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.3.0...release-8.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.3.0 (2025-06-23)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel now requires the minimal glibc version of 2.25.\r\n* Bazel now prints exactly which startup options have changed when the running Bazel server needs to be killed. ([#26034](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26034))\r\n\r\n## Apple / Xcode\r\n* Added support for dSYM generation to cc_binary. ([#26031](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26031))\r\n* On macOS, Bazel now respects the environment variable DEVELOPER_DIR for Xcode selection. ([#25885](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25885))\r\n\r\n## C / C++\r\n* Added strip_include_prefix to cc_import. ([#26296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26296))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function. ([#26129](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26129))\r\n* source.json now supports a new attribute `mirror_urls` as backup URLs for the source archive. ([#25937](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25937))\r\n* Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set. ([#26280](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26280))\r\n* repository_ctx.download_and_extract now supports the .whl file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427. ([#26323](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26323))\r\n* User-provided repo names may now start with a number. ([#26252](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26252))\r\n* Added a \"hidden\" lockfile under the output base that contains the output of reproducible module extensions for performance. ([#26195](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26195))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Add executable to stateful runfiles if necessary, avoiding a very costly check during analysis. ([#26288](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26288))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.2.1...release-8.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Levy, Adin Cebic, Benji Vos, benjivos, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Farid Zakaria, Greg, helly25, Jaden Peterson, Jim Carroll, John Millikin, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Zhongpeng Lin, and Alberto Cavalcante.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.3.0rc3 (2025-06-17)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel now prints exactly which startup options have changed when the running Bazel server needs to be killed. ([#26034](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26034))\r\n\r\n## Apple / Xcode\r\n* Added support for dSYM generation to cc_binary. ([#26031](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26031))\r\n* On macOS, Bazel now respects the environment variable DEVELOPER_DIR for Xcode selection. ([#25885](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25885))\r\n\r\n## C / C++\r\n* Added strip_include_prefix to cc_import. ([#26296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26296))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function. ([#26129](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26129))\r\n* source.json now supports a new attribute `mirror_urls` as backup URLs for the source archive. ([#25937](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25937))\r\n* Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set. ([#26280](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26280))\r\n* repository_ctx.download_and_extract now supports the .whl file extension for Python wheel files, treating them as ZIP archives under PEP 427. ([#26323](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26323))\r\n* User-provided repo names may now start with a number. ([#26252](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26252))\r\n* Added a \"hidden\" lockfile under the output base that contains the output of reproducible module extensions for performance. ([#26195](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26195))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Add executable to stateful runfiles if necessary, avoiding a very costly check during analysis. ([#26288](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26288))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.2.1...release-8.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Levy, Adin Cebic, Benji Vos, benjivos, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Farid Zakaria, Greg, helly25, Jaden Peterson, Jim Carroll, John Millikin, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Zhongpeng Lin, and Alberto Cavalcante.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.3.0rc2 (2025-06-17)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel now prints exactly which startup options have changed when the running Bazel server needs to be killed. ([#26034](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26034))\r\n\r\n## Apple / Xcode\r\n* Added support for dSYM generation to cc_binary. ([#26031](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26031))\r\n* On macOS, Bazel now respects the environment variable DEVELOPER_DIR for Xcode selection. ([#25885](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25885))\r\n\r\n## C / C++\r\n* Added strip_include_prefix to cc_import. ([#26296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26296))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function. ([#26129](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26129))\r\n* source.json now supports a new attribute `mirror_urls` as backup URLs for the source archive. ([#25937](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25937))\r\n* Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set. ([#26280](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26280))\r\n* User-provided repo names may now start with a number. ([#26252](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26252))\r\n* Added a \"hidden\" lockfile under the output base that contains the output of reproducible module extensions for performance. ([#26195](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26195))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Add executable to stateful runfiles if necessary, avoiding a very costly check during analysis. ([#26288](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26288))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.2.1...release-8.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Levy, Adin Cebic, Benji Vos, benjivos, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Farid Zakaria, Greg, helly25, Jaden Peterson, Jim Carroll, John Millikin, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Zhongpeng Lin, and Alberto Cavalcante.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.3.0rc1 (2025-06-16)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Bazel now prints exactly which startup options have changed when the running Bazel server needs to be killed. ([#26034](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26034))\r\n\r\n## Apple / Xcode\r\n* Added support for dSYM generation to cc_binary. ([#26031](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26031))\r\n* On macOS, Bazel now respects the environment variable DEVELOPER_DIR for Xcode selection. ([#25885](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25885))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Added a new flag `--repo_contents_cache` (defaults to the `contents` directory under the `--repository_cache`) where Bazel stores fetched contents of repos that can be safely cached across workspaces. A repo rule can indicate cacheability by returning `repository_ctx.repo_metadata(reproducible=True)` from its implementation function. ([#26129](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26129))\r\n* source.json now supports a new attribute `mirror_urls` as backup URLs for the source archive. ([#25937](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25937))\r\n* Added the `load_wasm` and `execute_wasm` methods to `repository_ctx` and `module_ctx` that allow repo rules and module extensions to run a WebAssembly binary. These methods are only available if `--experimental_repository_ctx_execute_wasm` is set. ([#26280](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26280))\r\n* User-provided repo names may now start with a number. ([#26252](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26252))\r\n* Added a \"hidden\" lockfile under the output base that contains the output of reproducible module extensions for performance. ([#26195](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26195))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Add executable to stateful runfiles if necessary, avoiding a very costly check during analysis. ([#26288](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/26288))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.2.1...release-8.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Aaron Levy, Adin Cebic, Benji Vos, benjivos, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Farid Zakaria, Greg, helly25, Jaden Peterson, Jim Carroll, John Millikin, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Zhongpeng Lin, and Alberto Cavalcante.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.2.1 (2025-04-17)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.2.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Fixed crash when setting --noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis with native.repository_name() ([#25850](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25850))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Fix atomic writes of `VirtualActionInput`s on Windows ([#25857](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25857))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix crash on lost inputs that are symlinks ([#25856](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25856))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.2.0...release-8.2.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.2.1rc1 (2025-04-15)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.2.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Fixed crash when setting --noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis with native.repository_name() ([#25850](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25850))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Fix atomic writes of `VirtualActionInput`s on Windows ([#25857](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25857))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix crash on lost inputs that are symlinks ([#25856](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25856))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.2.0...release-8.2.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.2.0 (2025-04-14)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Build Event Protocol\r\n* BEP will now always attempt to set exit_code on TestResult from the result of the test runner. ([#25278](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25278))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Add `missing_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type can't be found for a platform. ([#25284](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25284))\r\n* Add `use_target_platform_constraints` attribute to the `toolchain` rule. Although it is not used, it enables writing custom test toolchains that [will more naturally match](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SAOYTvd-3B7U6TH4M7ad2n1r0x2gS2Z0xE0v1NgqxJo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5mcn15i0e1ch) the target platform in Bazel 9.0. ([#25685](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25685))\r\n* Skylib's [analysis_test](https://bazel.build/rules/testing) supports testing Starlark analysis logic with --experimental_* and --incompatible_* flags. ([#25536](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25536))\r\n* Include DefaultInfo in cquery's [Starlark output](https://bazel.build/query/cquery#output-format-definition). ([#25719](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25719))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* The `repo_name` parameter of `bazel_dep` can now be set to `None` to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the `bazel_dep` specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25381](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25381))\r\n* `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used. ([#25660](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25660))\r\n* Added sparse_checkout_patterns and sparse_checkout_file arguments to the git_repository rule. If non-empty, this will cause the rule to perform a sparse checkout of the repository, only checking out files that match the .gitignore-style patterns in this list. ([#25765](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25765))\r\n* Literal dicts are now allowed as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel files. This makes it possible to use repo names that are not valid Starlark identifiers in override_repo and use_repo. ([#25611](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25611))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix a deadlock when using --remote_cache_async and HTTP cache. ([#25788](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25788))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro. ([#25772](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25772))\r\n* Added a new boolean flag --incompatible_disable_autoloads_in_main_repo, defaulting to false. When set to true, autoloads specified by `--incompatible_autoload_externally` are fully disabled in the main repo. This flag will be flipped to true by default in Bazel 9.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.2.0rc3 (2025-04-10)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Build Event Protocol\r\n* BEP will now always attempt to set exit_code on TestResult from the result of the test runner. ([#25278](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25278))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Add `missing_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type can't be found for a platform. ([#25284](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25284))\r\n* Add `use_target_platform_constraints` attribute to the `toolchain` rule. Although it is not used, it enables writing custom test toolchains that [will more naturally match](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SAOYTvd-3B7U6TH4M7ad2n1r0x2gS2Z0xE0v1NgqxJo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5mcn15i0e1ch) the target platform in Bazel 9.0. ([#25685](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25685))\r\n* Skylib's [analysis_test](https://bazel.build/rules/testing) supports testing Starlark analysis logic with --experimental_* and --incompatible_* flags. ([#25536](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25536))\r\n* Include DefaultInfo in cquery's [Starlark output](https://bazel.build/query/cquery#output-format-definition). ([#25719](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25719))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* The `repo_name` parameter of `bazel_dep` can now be set to `None` to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the `bazel_dep` specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25381](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25381))\r\n* `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used. ([#25660](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25660))\r\n* Added sparse_checkout_patterns and sparse_checkout_file arguments to the git_repository rule. If non-empty, this will cause the rule to perform a sparse checkout of the repository, only checking out files that match the .gitignore-style patterns in this list. ([#25765](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25765))\r\n* Literal dicts are now allowed as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel files. This makes it possible to use repo names that are not valid Starlark identifiers in override_repo and use_repo. ([#25611](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25611))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix a deadlock when using --remote_cache_async and HTTP cache. ([#25788](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25788))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro. ([#25772](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25772))\r\n* Added a new boolean flag --incompatible_disable_autoloads_in_main_repo, defaulting to false. When set to true, autoloads specified by `--incompatible_autoload_externally` are fully disabled in the main repo. This flag will be flipped to true by default in Bazel 9.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.2.0rc2 (2025-04-09)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Build Event Protocol\r\n* BEP will now always attempt to set exit_code on TestResult from the result of the test runner. ([#25278](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25278))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Add `missing_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type can't be found for a platform. ([#25284](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25284))\r\n* Add `use_target_platform_constraints` attribute to the `toolchain` rule. Although it is not used, it enables writing custom test toolchains that [will more naturally match](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SAOYTvd-3B7U6TH4M7ad2n1r0x2gS2Z0xE0v1NgqxJo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5mcn15i0e1ch) the target platform in Bazel 9.0. ([#25685](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25685))\r\n* Skylib's [analysis_test](https://bazel.build/rules/testing) supports testing Starlark analysis logic with --experimental_* and --incompatible_* flags. ([#25536](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25536))\r\n* Include DefaultInfo in cquery's [Starlark output](https://bazel.build/query/cquery#output-format-definition). ([#25719](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25719))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* The `repo_name` parameter of `bazel_dep` can now be set to `None` to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the `bazel_dep` specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25381](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25381))\r\n* `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used. ([#25660](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25660))\r\n* Added sparse_checkout_patterns and sparse_checkout_file arguments to the git_repository rule. If non-empty, this will cause the rule to perform a sparse checkout of the repository, only checking out files that match the .gitignore-style patterns in this list. ([#25765](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25765))\r\n* Literal dicts are now allowed as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel files. This makes it possible to use repo names that are not valid Starlark identifiers in override_repo and use_repo. ([#25611](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25611))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix a deadlock when using --remote_cache_async and HTTP cache. ([#25788](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25788))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro. ([#25772](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25772))\r\n* Added a new boolean flag --incompatible_disable_autoloads_in_main_repo, defaulting to false. When set to true, autoloads specified by `--incompatible_autoload_externally` are fully disabled in the main repo. This flag will be flipped to true by default in Bazel 9.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.2.0rc1 (2025-04-07)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Build Event Protocol\r\n* BEP will now always attempt to set exit_code on TestResult from the result of the test runner. ([#25278](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25278))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Add `missing_toolchain_error` to the `platform` rule, to customize error messages when a required toolchain type can't be found for a platform. ([#25284](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25284))\r\n* Add `use_target_platform_constraints` attribute to the `toolchain` rule. Although it is not used, it enables writing custom test toolchains that [will more naturally match](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SAOYTvd-3B7U6TH4M7ad2n1r0x2gS2Z0xE0v1NgqxJo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5mcn15i0e1ch) the target platform in Bazel 9.0. ([#25685](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25685))\r\n* Skylib's [analysis_test](https://bazel.build/rules/testing) supports testing Starlark analysis logic with --experimental_* and --incompatible_* flags. ([#25536](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25536))\r\n* Include DefaultInfo in cquery's [Starlark output](https://bazel.build/query/cquery#output-format-definition). ([#25719](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25719))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* The `repo_name` parameter of `bazel_dep` can now be set to `None` to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the `bazel_dep` specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25381](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25381))\r\n* `--experimental_downloader_config` is now no longer experimental, and has been renamed to `--downloader_config`. The old flag name can still be used. ([#25660](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25660))\r\n* Added sparse_checkout_patterns and sparse_checkout_file arguments to the git_repository rule. If non-empty, this will cause the rule to perform a sparse checkout of the repository, only checking out files that match the .gitignore-style patterns in this list. ([#25765](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25765))\r\n* Literal dicts are now allowed as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel files. This makes it possible to use repo names that are not valid Starlark identifiers in override_repo and use_repo. ([#25611](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25611))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Set generator_name, generator_function, generator_location, and the full Starlark stack for rule targets instantiated in a symbolic macro. ([#25772](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25772))\r\n* Added a new boolean flag --incompatible_disable_autoloads_in_main_repo, defaulting to false. When set to true, autoloads specified by `--incompatible_autoload_externally` are fully disabled in the main repo. This flag will be flipped to true by default in Bazel 9.

(2025-03-31)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't leak in-flight execution in RemoteSpawnCache ([#25688](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25688))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.6.0...release-7.6.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0 (2025-03-24)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number. ([#25549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25549))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n* Handle large numeric segments in Bazel module versions ([#25632](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25632))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n* Don't attempt to enable the Security Manager for jdk >= 24 ([#25658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25658))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc5 (2025-03-21)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number. ([#25549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25549))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n* Handle large numeric segments in Bazel module versions ([#25632](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25632))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n* Don't attempt to enable the Security Manager for jdk >= 24 ([#25658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25658))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc4 (2025-03-19)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number. ([#25549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25549))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n* Handle large numeric segments in Bazel module versions ([#25632](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25632))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc3 (2025-03-19)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* LCOV parsing does not break on FN lines including an end line number. ([#25549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25549))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc2 (2025-03-18)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n* Emit BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY when using @rules_cc//cc/runfiles ([#25424](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25424))\r\n* Permit literal dicts as extra keyword args in MODULE.bazel ([#25614](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25614))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Use runfiles path instead of root relative path in JavaStarlarkCommon.collectNativeLibsDirs ([#25548](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25548))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* build metrics: Do not set start/end of mnemonics that were only created but not executed. ([#25598](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25598))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim, Stig Rohde Døssing, and Garrett Holmstrom.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release 7.6.0rc1 (2025-03-11)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.6.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* The repo_name parameter of bazel_dep can now be set to None to mark it a \"nodep\" dependency -- that is, the bazel_dep specification is only honored if the target module already exists in the dependency graph by some other means. ([#25509](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25509))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't download all artifacts with BwoB when their TTL expires ([#25490](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25490))\r\n* Avoid downloading the empty Tree message ([#25489](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25489))\r\n* Actually fix setting the mtime on a shared disk cache. ([#25473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25473))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.5.0...release-7.6.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim, James Judd, and timothyklim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0 (2025-02-13)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Added conlyopts and cxxopts to objc_library. ([#25022](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25022))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* --experimental_downloader_config now supports the ~ character for the home directory. ([#24978](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24978))\r\n* Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#25191](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25191))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0rc4 (2025-02-11)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Added conlyopts and cxxopts to objc_library. ([#25022](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25022))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* --experimental_downloader_config now supports the ~ character for the home directory. ([#24978](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24978))\r\n* Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#25191](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25191))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0rc3 (2025-02-07)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via `--host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>`. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Added conlyopts and cxxopts to objc_library. ([#25022](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25022))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* --experimental_downloader_config now supports the ~ character for the home directory. ([#24978](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24978))\r\n* Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#25191](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25191))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0rc2 (2025-02-05)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via --host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Added repository_ctx.original_name, which contains the original value of the name attribute as specified at the repo rule call site. ([#25191](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25191))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 8.1.0rc1 (2025-02-04)\r\n\r\nBazel 8.1.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 8.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* On Linux, the default limit on the number of --watchfs file events per directory has been raised to 10,000 (from 500). If needed, it can be increased further via --host_jvm_args=-Djdk.nio.file.WatchService.maxEventsPerPoll=<limit>. ([#24872](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/24872))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Changing any part of --run_under that isn't the label (such as the shell command) no longer invalidates the analysis cache. ([#25023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25023))\r\n* The new no_match_error attribute on toolchain_type can be used to show a custom message when no matching toolchain is found for that type, but one is required. ([#25178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25178))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* CAS requests made when Bazel downloads a blob with Build without the Bytes enabled now provide metadata with an action ID of input if the blob is downloaded as the input to a local action and output if it is a requested action output. ([#25058](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25058))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Add a set data type to Starlark. ([#25111](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/25111))\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-8.0.1...release-8.1.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Boleyn Su, Fabian Meumertzheim, Keith Smiley, Kiron, Pareesh Madan, and Sarad Pant.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n**The following release notes are still in the process of being updated. For a more up-to-date version, take a look at the **[release announcements doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/187EF3dyCBz8ed3P9w7YTO5yPKU1pensNt3HA8be84Ms/edit#heading=h.vswxwomb18dc)**.**\r\n\r\n# Release 8.0.0rc2 (2024-10-28)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  d0285222b0060847d815d87d6757ca22e43ebd93\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference): * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration. * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform. * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see #18265).\r\n+ \"bazel aquery\" now returns the headers C++ compilation actions can include if the --include_scheduling_dependencies command line option is set.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** transition is removed from objc_library (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688)\r\n+ This change will set the default size limit for named set of files in BEP from unlimited to 5000. In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Delete the --experimental_execution_log_file flag. Use --execution_log_binary_file in conjunction with --noexecution_log_sort instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default. See #19915 for migration advice.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Incoming transitions on rules can't be set to \"exec\" transition.\r\n+ The global \"applicable_licenses\" attribute has been renamed to \"package_metadata\". The older name may be used for creating targets, but starlark code must use the name \"package_metadata\" to retrieve it.  Breaking change.\r\n+ WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n+ `--incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars` is a no-op\r\n+ JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n+ The invocation URL in the terminal is now prominently colorized in blue.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n+ `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with `--enable_bzlmod`: 1. root module's module file 2. `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` 3. non-root modules' module files 4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` or execution platforms)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a no-op, enabled by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a no op rule (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits. * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n+ Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n+ Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to True) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off.\r\n+ Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`. * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`. * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.local_target_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n+ The invocation URL is re-colorized to cyan from blue due to readability issues with dark backgrounds.\r\n+ Label.local_target_label is renamed to Label.same_package_label.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** progress messages print short primary input and output without root base\r\n+ Update iOS tutorial link.\r\n+ The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed It has been a no-op for several years now.\r\n+ Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n+ modifies visibility error to be more readable.\r\n+ fixes overly-broad test assertion\r\n+ The deprecated `fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode` and `fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode` APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping)\r\n+ `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching.\r\n+ Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The \"input_manifests\" argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n+ BEP's `execution_phase_time_in_ms` no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in `execution_phase_time_in_ms` expected.\r\n+ The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`.\r\n+ Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n+ The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n+ Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes, Bazel will refetch the repo.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp fragments instead.\r\n+ Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.\r\n+ `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag).\r\n+ The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values` for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n+ Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n+ New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n+ Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable.\r\n+ The `local_repository` and `new_local_repository` repository rules are now available as Starlark rules under `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:local.bzl`. They are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts, and can be used in module extensions.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables\r\n+ incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is a no-op\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Flipped --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n+ Added `bazel dump --skyframe=function_graph` to generate a DOT file representing the relationship between `SkyFunction` implementations in the Bazel skyframe graph.\r\n+ aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior.\r\n+ toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.\r\n+ Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to `C:/msys64` instead of `C:/tools/msys64`.\r\n+ `distribs()` at the package level is no longer legal syntax. It may still be set on individual targets, even though it is a no-op.\r\n+ Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files.\r\n+ `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`).\r\n+ bzlmod `git_repository` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call.\r\n+ BEP now contains data similar to `dump` command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys\r\n+ Delete the native AndroidDevice rule. This follows the deletion of the native AndroidTest and AndroidInstrumentationTest rules.\r\n+ Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets.\r\n+ `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n+ The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event.\r\n+ The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available).\r\n+ The format for MODULE.bazel.lock is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured).\r\n+ The native aar_import is no longer provided in Bazel. See github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n+ The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`.\r\n+ A no-op transition is now available as `config.target()`.\r\n+ The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled.\r\n+ Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`.\r\n+ `cc_toolchain` now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n+ `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n+ Changes to environment variables read via `getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions.\r\n+ `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` is flipped to `true`.\r\n+ Progress is no longer written to BEP after the build completing event is posted.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** path attribute is removed from filegroup\r\n+ Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup.\r\n+ Deleted Bazel's builtin aar_import helper tools. They live in rules_android now.\r\n+ `query` now uses 3% less RAM.\r\n+ `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` defaults to `5`.\r\n+ `genquery` now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage. The default value of `--skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation` and `--skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation` has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n+ Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`.\r\n+ Stop exposing the AndroidPlatformsTransition to Starlark.\r\n+ Added `--experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler` to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: `BZL_LOAD`, `GLOB`, `GLOBS`, `PACKAGE`, `CONFIGURED_TARGET`, `ASPECT`, `ACTION_EXECUTION`.\r\n+ `--compile_one_dependency` selects header-only `cc_library`s in more cases\r\n+ The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (`+`) instead of tilde (`~`). Effectively, this flips the flag `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\").\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_ndk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_local_test rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ BEP will include correct \\`TestResult\\` and \\`TargetSummary\\` events when special test inputs like \\`$test_runtime\\` fail to build.\r\n+ Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n+ aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files= field is supported.\r\n+ The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`.\r\n+ Deleted native Android mobile-install\r\n+ Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n+ A new experimental flag, `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode`, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is `FILESET` which populates `OutputGroup.file_sets`. Users may now specify `INLINE` to instead report files directly in the `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete` event under `OutputGroup.inline_files`. Users may also specify `BOTH` to populate `OutputGroup.file_sets` and `OutputGroup.inline_files`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `ctx.resolve_tools` is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249 for migration instructions. Use `--noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools` to temporarily make it available again.\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_binary, android_library, android_device_script_fixture and android_host_service_fixture rules. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_sdk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is removed.\r\n+ `--build_event_upload_max_threads` is removed.\r\n+ `incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root` is removed.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold` is changed to `100`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `aquery` command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the `unused_inputs_list` argument to `ctx.actions.run`. Set `--noinclude_pruned_inputs` to omit pruned inputs from `aquery` output when running it after action execution. **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the `--windows_enable_symlinks` flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set `--noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n+ By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the `TargetComplete` event. To disable this behavior, pass `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only`.\r\n+ Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set `--noremote_cache_async` to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n+ Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n+ Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs`.\r\n+ Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n+ The native version of android_tools_defaults_jar is no longer in Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n+ The compact execution log now stores runfiles in a more compact representation that should reduce the memory overhead and log output size, in particular for test spawns. This change required breaking changes to the (experimental) log format.\r\n+ `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions.\r\n+ Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n+ If `--allowed_cpu_values` is set, the `--cpu` flag value is validated against it.\r\n+ Native android_sdk is no longer available within Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use `@rpath` to find their `.dylib` dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies.\r\n+ Add the --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs option to simplify configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects; for example, if [\"a\"] + select(\"//conditions:default\", [\"b\"]) is assigned to a rule attribute, it is stored as [\"a\", \"b\"].\r\n+ `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is deleted.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` and `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` are deleted.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is changed to `5`.\r\n+ If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n+ Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain \"//visibility:public\" and \"//visibility:private\" elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute: [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:public\"] is saved as [\"//visibility:public\"], [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:private\"] is saved as [\"//foo:__subpackages__\"], and for consistency's sake, an empty target visibility list [] is saved as [\"//visibility:private\"].\r\n+ Symbolic Macros -- and with them, Finalizers and the new Macro-Aware Visibility model -- are now generally available (`--experimental_enable_first_class_macros` now defaults to true). Trivial `select()` values are automatically unwrapped (`--incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs` now defaults to true).\r\n+ Moved all Bazel Android tool and action code to rules_android.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file. - --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules\r\n+ `@bazel_tools//tools/android` no longer exists. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob` now defaults to true.\r\n+ Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path.\r\n+ The \"blaze --quiet\" command line option can now be used to make Blaze emit much less output.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.4.0 (2024-10-22)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path. ([#23912](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23912))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.) ([#23550](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23550))\r\n* Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes. ([#23585](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23585))\r\n* Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns. ([#23663](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23663))\r\n* Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module. ([#23757](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23757))\r\n* `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions. ([#23938](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23938))\r\n* When using vendor mode, the vendor dir is automatically ignored while package loading ([#23919](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23919))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case. ([#23357](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23357))\r\n* Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache). ([#23561](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23561))\r\n* Implemented disk cache garbage collection ([#23833](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23833))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`. ([#23392](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23392))\r\n* Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules ([#23904](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23904))\r\n* Auto-load with language specific rules that're removed from Bazel with --incompatible_autoload_externally ([#23906](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23906))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.2...release-7.4.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Benjamin Peterson, Cornelius Riemenschneider, Daniel Wagner-Hall, David Sanderson, Dennis van den Berg, Fabian Meumertzheim, FaBrand, Fredrik Medley, George Gensure, Grzegorz Lukasik, Jamison Lahman, Jay Conrod, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Laurent Le Brun, Lior Gorelik, Luis Padron, Michael Siegrist, Son Luong Ngoc, Tom Renn, and xinyu.wang.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.4.0rc4 (2024-10-18)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path. ([#23912](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23912))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.) ([#23550](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23550))\r\n* Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes. ([#23585](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23585))\r\n* Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns. ([#23663](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23663))\r\n* Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module. ([#23757](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23757))\r\n* `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions. ([#23938](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23938))\r\n* When using vendor mode, the vendor dir is automatically ignored while package loading ([#23919](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23919))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case. ([#23357](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23357))\r\n* Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache). ([#23561](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23561))\r\n* Implemented disk cache garbage collection ([#23833](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23833))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`. ([#23392](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23392))\r\n* Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules ([#23904](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23904))\r\n* Auto-load with language specific rules that're removed from Bazel with --incompatible_autoload_externally ([#23906](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23906))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.2...release-7.4.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Benjamin Peterson, Cornelius Riemenschneider, Daniel Wagner-Hall, David Sanderson, Dennis van den Berg, Fabian Meumertzheim, FaBrand, Fredrik Medley, George Gensure, Grzegorz Lukasik, Jamison Lahman, Jay Conrod, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Laurent Le Brun, Lior Gorelik, Luis Padron, Michael Siegrist, Son Luong Ngoc, Tom Renn, and xinyu.wang.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.4.0rc3 (2024-10-17)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path. ([#23912](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23912))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.) ([#23550](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23550))\r\n* Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes. ([#23585](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23585))\r\n* Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns. ([#23663](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23663))\r\n* Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module. ([#23757](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23757))\r\n* `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions. ([#23938](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23938))\r\n* When using vendor mode, the vendor dir is automatically ignored while package loading ([#23919](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23919))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case. ([#23357](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23357))\r\n* Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache). ([#23561](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23561))\r\n* Implemented disk cache garbage collection ([#23833](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23833))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`. ([#23392](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23392))\r\n* Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules ([#23904](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23904))\r\n* Auto-load with language specific rules that're removed from Bazel with --incompatible_autoload_externally ([#23906](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23906))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.2...release-7.4.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Benjamin Peterson, Cornelius Riemenschneider, Daniel Wagner-Hall, David Sanderson, Dennis van den Berg, Fabian Meumertzheim, FaBrand, Fredrik Medley, George Gensure, Grzegorz Lukasik, Jamison Lahman, Jay Conrod, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Laurent Le Brun, Lior Gorelik, Luis Padron, Michael Siegrist, Son Luong Ngoc, Tom Renn, and xinyu.wang.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.4.0rc2 (2024-10-15)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path. ([#23912](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23912))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.) ([#23550](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23550))\r\n* Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes. ([#23585](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23585))\r\n* Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns. ([#23663](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23663))\r\n* Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module. ([#23757](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23757))\r\n* `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions. ([#23938](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23938))\r\n* When using vendor mode, the vendor dir is automatically ignored while package loading ([#23919](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23919))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case. ([#23357](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23357))\r\n* Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache). ([#23561](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23561))\r\n* Implemented disk cache garbage collection ([#23833](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23833))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`. ([#23392](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23392))\r\n* Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules ([#23904](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23904))\r\n* Auto-load with language specific rules that're removed from Bazel with --incompatible_autoload_externally ([#23906](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23906))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.2...release-7.4.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Benjamin Peterson, Cornelius Riemenschneider, Daniel Wagner-Hall, David Sanderson, Dennis van den Berg, Fabian Meumertzheim, FaBrand, Fredrik Medley, George Gensure, Grzegorz Lukasik, Jamison Lahman, Jay Conrod, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Laurent Le Brun, Lior Gorelik, Luis Padron, Michael Siegrist, Son Luong Ngoc, Tom Renn, and xinyu.wang.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.4.0rc1 (2024-10-10)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path. ([#23912](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23912))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.) ([#23550](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23550))\r\n* Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes. ([#23585](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23585))\r\n* Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns. ([#23663](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23663))\r\n* Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module. ([#23757](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23757))\r\n* `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions. ([#23938](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23938))\r\n* When using vendor mode, the vendor dir is automatically ignored while package loading ([#23919](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23919))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case. ([#23357](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23357))\r\n* Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache). ([#23561](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23561))\r\n* Implemented disk cache garbage collection ([#23833](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23833))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`. ([#23392](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23392))\r\n* Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules ([#23904](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23904))\r\n* Auto-load with language specific rules that're removed from Bazel with --incompatible_autoload_externally ([#23906](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23906))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.2...release-7.4.0) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Benjamin Peterson, Cornelius Riemenschneider, Daniel Wagner-Hall, David Sanderson, Dennis van den Berg, Fabian Meumertzheim, FaBrand, Fredrik Medley, George Gensure, Grzegorz Lukasik, Jamison Lahman, Jay Conrod, Jordan Mele, Keith Smiley, Laurent Le Brun, Lior Gorelik, Luis Padron, Michael Siegrist, Son Luong Ngoc, Tom Renn, and xinyu.wang.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n**The following release notes are still in the process of being updated. For a more up-to-date version, take a look at the **[release announcements doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/187EF3dyCBz8ed3P9w7YTO5yPKU1pensNt3HA8be84Ms/edit#heading=h.vswxwomb18dc)**.**\r\n\r\n# Release 8.0.0rc1 (2024-10-08)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  d0285222b0060847d815d87d6757ca22e43ebd93\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference): * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration. * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform. * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see #18265).\r\n+ \"bazel aquery\" now returns the headers C++ compilation actions can include if the --include_scheduling_dependencies command line option is set.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** transition is removed from objc_library (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688)\r\n+ This change will set the default size limit for named set of files in BEP from unlimited to 5000. In the event that the limit is reached, the message will be split.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Delete the --experimental_execution_log_file flag. Use --execution_log_binary_file in conjunction with --noexecution_log_sort instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default. See #19915 for migration advice.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Incoming transitions on rules can't be set to \"exec\" transition.\r\n+ The global \"applicable_licenses\" attribute has been renamed to \"package_metadata\". The older name may be used for creating targets, but starlark code must use the name \"package_metadata\" to retrieve it.  Breaking change.\r\n+ WorkerMetrics of killed workers are logged (max 50 based on custom prioritization and then arranged in order of worker id). WorkerMetrics also includes the number of actions executed by each worker are now logged in the BEP. The semantics of WorkerPoolStats.evicted_count to refer to the workers that are killed (destroyed) as a result of memory pressure (evicted_count <= destroyed_count).\r\n+ `--incompatible_depset_for_java_output_source_jars` is a no-op\r\n+ JavaInfo.compilation_info.javac_options now returns a depset. Use tokenize_javacopts from @rules_java to get the options as a correctly ordered list.\r\n+ The invocation URL in the terminal is now prominently colorized in blue.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n+ `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with `--enable_bzlmod`: 1. root module's module file 2. `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` 3. non-root modules' module files 4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` or execution platforms)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution is a no-op, enabled by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** cc_toolchain_suite is a no op rule (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits. * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n+ Log all WorkerPoolStats for all worker pools (even though workers aren't created or destroyed). Also add unknown_destroyed_count and alive_count to the WorkerPoolStats proto.\r\n+ Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to True) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off.\r\n+ Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`. * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`. * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.local_target_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Passing a FilesToRunProvider to coverage_support_files will now result in an error as opposed to being silently ignored.\r\n+ The invocation URL is re-colorized to cyan from blue due to readability issues with dark backgrounds.\r\n+ Label.local_target_label is renamed to Label.same_package_label.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** progress messages print short primary input and output without root base\r\n+ Update iOS tutorial link.\r\n+ The package(distribs=[...]) attribute has been removed It has been a no-op for several years now.\r\n+ Prevent linux-sandbox(ed) spawns from being able to write in the cgroups mount.\r\n+ modifies visibility error to be more readable.\r\n+ fixes overly-broad test assertion\r\n+ The deprecated `fragments[\"apple\"].bitcode_mode` and `fragments[\"cpp\"].apple_bitcode_mode` APIs have been removed from Bazel. Apple deprecated Bitcode in Xcode 14.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** CppLinkAction returns 2 args to aspects that have correct quoting set (before it was always 1 args object defaulting to bash escaping)\r\n+ `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching.\r\n+ Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --host_jvm_profile command line argument is not supported anymore.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The \"input_manifests\" argument of ctx.actions.{run,run_shell} is now a no-op. resolve_command and resolve_tools always return the empty list as the input manifest list.\r\n+ BEP's `execution_phase_time_in_ms` no longer includes the analysis-only part at the beginning of the build. Artificial downtrend in `execution_phase_time_in_ms` expected.\r\n+ The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`.\r\n+ Introduce new flag --experimental_worker_use_cgroups_on_linux that uses cgroups to track memory usage for singleplex workers (on Linux).\r\n+ The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Coverage report generators don't get anymore the JAVA_RUNFILES and PYTHON_RUNFILES environment variables.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** apple_cc_toolchain rule was removed, use regular cc_toolchain\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** \"bazel query\" and \"bazel print_action\" can't run under the output base anymore.\r\n+ Added a new method, `repository_ctx.watch()`, which asks Bazel to watch for changes to an arbitrary file. When said file changes, Bazel will refetch the repo.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The Starlark methods copts, generate_linkmap, should_strip_binary in objc fragment have been deleted.  Please use the equivalent methods objccopts, objc_generate_linkmap, objc_should_strip_binary in cpp fragments instead.\r\n+ Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.\r\n+ `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag).\r\n+ The result of `canonicalize-flags` now includes all Starlark flags by default. Use `--noexperimental_include_default_values` for the old behavior that only reports Starlark flags with non-default values.\r\n+ Added `windows_quoting_for_param_files` feature for windows-style parameter file escaping.\r\n+ New $(DUMPBIN) make variable is now available for Visual Studio toolchains.\r\n+ Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable.\r\n+ The `local_repository` and `new_local_repository` repository rules are now available as Starlark rules under `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:local.bzl`. They are drop-in replacements for their native counterparts, and can be used in module extensions.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** removed def_file from cc_common.create_link_variables\r\n+ incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone is a no-op\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** Flipped --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods\r\n+ Added `bazel dump --skyframe=function_graph` to generate a DOT file representing the relationship between `SkyFunction` implementations in the Bazel skyframe graph.\r\n+ aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior.\r\n+ toolchain type requirements of rules are now treated as implicit dependencies in `bazel query`. This includes those defined via the `toolchains` parameter of starlark `rule()` definitions.\r\n+ Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** On Windows, the default msys64 root is changed to `C:/msys64` instead of `C:/tools/msys64`.\r\n+ `distribs()` at the package level is no longer legal syntax. It may still be set on individual targets, even though it is a no-op.\r\n+ Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files.\r\n+ `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`).\r\n+ bzlmod `git_repository` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call.\r\n+ BEP now contains data similar to `dump` command breakdowns for rules, aspects and skykeys\r\n+ Delete the native AndroidDevice rule. This follows the deletion of the native AndroidTest and AndroidInstrumentationTest rules.\r\n+ Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets.\r\n+ `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n+ The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event.\r\n+ The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available).\r\n+ The format for MODULE.bazel.lock is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured).\r\n+ The native aar_import is no longer provided in Bazel. See github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android.\r\n+ The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`.\r\n+ A no-op transition is now available as `config.target()`.\r\n+ The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled.\r\n+ Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`.\r\n+ `cc_toolchain` now passes runfiles for its *_files attrs (e.g. data files for a tool built for linking).\r\n+ `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format and --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file command line options are not available anymore.\r\n+ Changes to environment variables read via `getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions.\r\n+ `--experimental_collect_system_network_usage` is flipped to `true`.\r\n+ Progress is no longer written to BEP after the build completing event is posted.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** path attribute is removed from filegroup\r\n+ Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup.\r\n+ Deleted Bazel's builtin aar_import helper tools. They live in rules_android now.\r\n+ `query` now uses 3% less RAM.\r\n+ `--experimental_repository_downloader_retries` defaults to `5`.\r\n+ `genquery` now supports (unconfigured) cycles, but may have higher peak memory usage. The default value of `--skyframe_high_water_mark_minor_gc_drops_per_invocation` and `--skyframe_high_water_mark_full_gc_drops_per_invocation` has been decreased to 10, which can result in Bazel OOMing more eagerly as Skyframe state is no longer dropped an unlimited number of times in response to high memory pressure.\r\n+ Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`.\r\n+ Stop exposing the AndroidPlatformsTransition to Starlark.\r\n+ Added `--experimental_collect_skyframe_counts_in_profiler` to collect Skyframe node counts in the JSON profile over time. Currently, the following SkyFunctions are measured: `BZL_LOAD`, `GLOB`, `GLOBS`, `PACKAGE`, `CONFIGURED_TARGET`, `ASPECT`, `ACTION_EXECUTION`.\r\n+ `--compile_one_dependency` selects header-only `cc_library`s in more cases\r\n+ The format of canonical repo names has changed to use plus (`+`) instead of tilde (`~`). Effectively, this flips the flag `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` to true, and the flag is now a no-op (i.e. cannot be \"unflipped\").\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_ndk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android_ndk instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_local_test rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ BEP will include correct \\`TestResult\\` and \\`TargetSummary\\` events when special test inputs like \\`$test_runtime\\` fail to build.\r\n+ Improve progress message in case there are no actions in flight, and display explicitly \"no actions running\" in that case.\r\n+ aspects can now return DefaultInfo, which will then be merged with that of the configured target they are applied to. Currently, only the files= field is supported.\r\n+ The new `cc_static_library` rule produces a static library that bundles given targets and all their transitive dependencies. It has to be enabled via `--experimental_cc_static_library`.\r\n+ Deleted native Android mobile-install\r\n+ Repository rules instantiated in the same module extensions can now refer to each other by their extension-specified names in label attributes.\r\n+ A new experimental flag, `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode`, allows users to change how a given output group's files are reported in BEP. The current behavior is `FILESET` which populates `OutputGroup.file_sets`. Users may now specify `INLINE` to instead report files directly in the `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete` event under `OutputGroup.inline_files`. Users may also specify `BOTH` to populate `OutputGroup.file_sets` and `OutputGroup.inline_files`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `ctx.resolve_tools` is no longer available by default, in preparation for complete removal. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/22249 for migration instructions. Use `--noincompatible_disallow_ctx_resolve_tools` to temporarily make it available again.\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_binary, android_library, android_device_script_fixture and android_host_service_fixture rules. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/23199\r\n+ Bazel no longer has the android_sdk_repository rule. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is removed.\r\n+ `--build_event_upload_max_threads` is removed.\r\n+ `incompatible_remote_output_paths_relative_to_input_root` is removed.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_compression_threshold` is changed to `100`.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The `aquery` command now reports all potential inputs of actions that support input discovery, including the input headers of C++ compilation actions and those explicitly marked as unused through the `unused_inputs_list` argument to `ctx.actions.run`. Set `--noinclude_pruned_inputs` to omit pruned inputs from `aquery` output when running it after action execution. **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Symlink trees are now created through direct filesystem calls by default, instead of delegated to a helper process. On Windows, this entails respecting the `--windows_enable_symlinks` flag, falling back to a copy when the flag is unset (the helper process always attempts to create symlinks, irrespective of the flag). Set `--noexperimental_inprocess_symlink_creation` to temporarily revert to the previous behavior, which will be removed in a future release.\r\n+ By default, coverage artifacts will be reported inline in the `TargetComplete` event. To disable this behavior, pass `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=named_set_of_files_only`.\r\n+ Uploading local action results to a disk or remote cache now occurs in the background whenever possible, potentially unblocking the execution of followup actions. Set `--noremote_cache_async` to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n+ Overrides in the root MODULE.bazel file are now ignored with `--ignore_dev_dependency`. (Overrides in non-root modules are already ignored.)\r\n+ Added support for using a remote cache that evicts blobs and doesn't have AC integrity check (e.g. HTTP cache).\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Undeclared test outputs are now reported individually in the BEP, unless zipping is enabled via `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs`.\r\n+ Bazel can now parse .scl files, a dialect of Starlark without Bazel-specific symbols.\r\n+ The native version of android_tools_defaults_jar is no longer in Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ Bazel fetch and vendor command now supports --target_pattern_file for specifying target patterns.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file.\r\n+ Dormant dependencies and materializer functions are now available with the --experimental_dormant_deps flag.\r\n+ The compact execution log now stores runfiles in a more compact representation that should reduce the memory overhead and log output size, in particular for test spawns. This change required breaking changes to the (experimental) log format.\r\n+ `override_repo` and `inject_repo` can be used to override and inject repos in module extensions.\r\n+ Patches to the module file in `single_version_override` are now effective as long as the patch file lies in the root module.\r\n+ If `--allowed_cpu_values` is set, the `--cpu` flag value is validated against it.\r\n+ Native android_sdk is no longer available within Bazel. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** With the default Unix toolchain on macOS, binaries now use `@rpath` to find their `.dylib` dependencies. This is required to fix issues where tools run during the build couldn't find their dynamic dependencies.\r\n+ Add the --incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs option to simplify configurable rule attributes which contain only unconditional selects; for example, if [\"a\"] + select(\"//conditions:default\", [\"b\"]) is assigned to a rule attribute, it is stored as [\"a\", \"b\"].\r\n+ `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is deleted.\r\n+ `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` and `--incompatible_remote_dangling_symlinks` are deleted.\r\n+ The default value of `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` is changed to `5`.\r\n+ If --proto:rule_classes flag is enabled, query proto output will contain rule class definitions in Stardoc proto format.\r\n+ Non-singleton target visibility lists can now contain \"//visibility:public\" and \"//visibility:private\" elements; the result is appropriately simplified when assigned to an attribute: [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:public\"] is saved as [\"//visibility:public\"], [\"//foo:__subpackages__\", \"//visibility:private\"] is saved as [\"//foo:__subpackages__\"], and for consistency's sake, an empty target visibility list [] is saved as [\"//visibility:private\"].\r\n+ Symbolic Macros -- and with them, Finalizers and the new Macro-Aware Visibility model -- are now generally available (`--experimental_enable_first_class_macros` now defaults to true). Trivial `select()` values are automatically unwrapped (`--incompatible_simplify_unconditional_selects_in_rule_attrs` now defaults to true).\r\n+ Moved all Bazel Android tool and action code to rules_android.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** This is not a release note, but a reminder to remove the note for `--include_scheduling_dependencies`, which was introduced in the 8.x tree but won't make it into the final release. - `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now defaults to false, causing undeclared test outputs (i.e., files written to `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR` by a test) to be produced as a directory instead of a zip file. - --legacy_important_outputs is flipped to false. See #14353 for details\r\n+ Add conlyopts and cxxopts attributes to cc rules\r\n+ `@bazel_tools//tools/android` no longer exists. Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android instead.\r\n+ **[Incompatible]** The flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob` now defaults to true.\r\n+ Bazel now supports all characters in the rlocation and target paths of runfiles and can be run from workspaces with a space in their full path.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Adam Azarchs, Adam Singer, Alan Falloon, Alessandro Patti, Alex Eagle, Alex Sharoff, Alexander Golovlev, Alexandre Boulgakov, Artem V.

(2024-10-01)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.2 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Add support for using the java rules from @rules_java ([#23779](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23779))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.1...release-7.3.2) for more details.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.1 (2024-08-19)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## ExternalDeps\r\n* Fixed the lockfile always being considered out of date when `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` is set. ([#23281](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23281))\r\n* Fixed a crash when vendoring alias targets. ([#23309](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23309))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Revert \"Deduplicate locally executed path mapped spawns” ([#23290](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23290))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.0...release-7.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.1rc2 (2024-08-14)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## ExternalDeps\r\n* Fixed the lockfile always being considered out of date when `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` is set. ([#23281](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23281))\r\n* Fixed a crash when vendoring alias targets. ([#23309](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23309))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Revert \"Deduplicate locally executed path mapped spawns” ([#23290](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23290))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.0...release-7.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

(2024-08-13)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## ExternalDeps\r\n* Fixed the lockfile always being considered out of date when `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` is set. ([#23281](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23281))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.0...release-7.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.0 (2024-08-12)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Bazel now supports vendoring external dependencies with Bzlmod, see https://bazel.build/external/vendor for details. ([#22794](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22794))\r\n* Added a new flag, --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names, which uses the plus character (+) instead of the tilde (~) in canonical repo names. This flag will be flipped to true in Bazel 8.0. ([#23127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23127))\r\n* The extract method is now available on module_ctx. ([#22825](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22825))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`. For more information, refer to the discussion [#22658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658). ([#22876](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22876))\r\n* Actions that become identical when path mapped are now deduplicated during local execution ([#21043](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21043))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.1...release-7.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Honnix, Jordan Mele, Laurent Le Brun, and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.0rc2 (2024-08-07)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Bazel now supports vendoring external dependencies with Bzlmod, see https://bazel.build/external/vendor for details. ([#22794](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22794))\r\n* Added a new flag, --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names, which uses the plus character (+) instead of the tilde (~) in canonical repo names. This flag will be flipped to true in Bazel 8.0. ([#23127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23127))\r\n* The extract method is now available on module_ctx. ([#22825](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22825))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`. For more information, refer to the discussion [#22658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658). ([#22876](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22876))\r\n* Actions that become identical when path mapped are now deduplicated during local execution ([#21043](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21043))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.1...release-7.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Honnix, Jordan Mele, Laurent Le Brun, and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.0rc1 (2024-07-29)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Bazel now supports vendoring external dependencies with Bzlmod, see https://bazel.build/external/vendor for details. ([#22794](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22794))\r\n* Added a new flag, --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names, which uses the plus character (+) instead of the tilde (~) in canonical repo names. This flag will be flipped to true in Bazel 8.0. ([#23127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23127))\r\n* The extract method is now available on module_ctx. ([#22825](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22825))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`. For more information, refer to the discussion [#22658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658). ([#22876](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22876))\r\n* Actions that become identical when path mapped are now deduplicated during local execution ([#21043](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21043))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.1...release-7.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Honnix, Jordan Mele, Laurent Le Brun, and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.1 (2024-06-25)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Replace //external:android/d8_jar_import with \"@android_gmaven_r8//jar\" ([#22699](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22699))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix crash on IOException in SingleExtensionEvalFunction ([#22697](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22697))\r\n* You can now discard previous overrides for --override_repository and --override_module by specifying an empty path. For example, if --override_repository=myrepo=/foo is followed by --override_repository=myrepo=, then myrepo will not be overridden. ([#22784](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22784))\r\n* Overlay files specified in source.json are now assumed to be under the `overlay` subdirectory. ([#22823](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22823))\r\n* Fixed an issue with the WORKSPACE file still being evaluated when `--noenable_workspace` is set. ([#22837](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22837))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix an NPE with the compact execution log and coverage ([#22707](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22707))\r\n* Retry on connection reset error for http cache. ([#22785](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22785))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Fix permissions on tree artifact subdirectories as needed to move them out of the sandbox. ([#22806](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22806))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Do not fail a sandboxed spawn for missing execution statistics ([#22790](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22790))\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.2.1rc2 (2024-06-21)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Replace //external:android/d8_jar_import with \"@android_gmaven_r8//jar\" ([#22699](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22699))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix crash on IOException in SingleExtensionEvalFunction ([#22697](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22697))\r\n* You can now discard previous overrides for --override_repository and --override_module by specifying an empty path. For example, if --override_repository=myrepo=/foo is followed by --override_repository=myrepo=, then myrepo will not be overridden. ([#22784](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22784))\r\n* Overlay files specified in source.json are now assumed to be under the `overlay` subdirectory. ([#22823](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22823))\r\n* Fixed an issue with the WORKSPACE file still being evaluated when `--noenable_workspace` is set. ([#22837](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22837))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix an NPE with the compact execution log and coverage ([#22707](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22707))\r\n* Retry on connection reset error for http cache. ([#22785](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22785))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Fix permissions on tree artifact subdirectories as needed to move them out of the sandbox. ([#22806](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22806))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Do not fail a sandboxed spawn for missing execution statistics ([#22790](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22790))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.0...release-7.2.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0 (2024-06-10)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n* Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup. ([#22650](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22650))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc3 (2024-06-05)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n* Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup. ([#22650](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22650))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc2 (2024-05-29)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc1 (2024-05-15)\r\n\r\nBaseline: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3e4e2af78d5b7d210094acfe43abdda23b185be1\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n    * Known issue: bazel mod tidy doesn't yet work with include()d segments. Will be fixed in rc2.\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Set public visibility for R8 desugar binary ([#22176](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22176))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fixed excessive repo fetching caused by changes to `.netrc` ([#22186](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22186))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't upload remote input to remote cache ([#21941](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21941))\r\n* Implement RemoteActionFileSystem#statIfFound correctly when the path cannot be canonicalized ([#21889](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21889))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Set public visibility for R8 desugar binary ([#22176](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22176))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fixed excessive repo fetching caused by changes to `.netrc` ([#22186](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22186))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't upload remote input to remote cache ([#21941](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21941))\r\n* Implement RemoteActionFileSystem#statIfFound correctly when the path cannot be canonicalized ([#21889](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21889))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.2rc1 (2024-05-06)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  3e4e2af78d5b7d210094acfe43abdda23b185be1\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.2 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fixed excessive repo fetching caused by changes to `.netrc` ([#22186](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22186))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't upload remote input to remote cache ([#21941](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21941))\r\n* Implement RemoteActionFileSystem#statIfFound correctly when the path cannot be canonicalized ([#21889](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21889))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.1 (2024-03-21)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  9b39ccaa33069c9f5688bef477abcd75e4378f04\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n* Reverted the 7.1.0 change to make `bazel fetch` use `cquery` under the hood ([#21735](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21735))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n* Fix sandbox cleanup crashing after server restart ([#21733](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21733))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.1rc2 (2024-03-19)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  9b39ccaa33069c9f5688bef477abcd75e4378f04\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n* Reverted the 7.1.0 change to make `bazel fetch` use `cquery` under the hood ([#21735](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21735))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n* Fix sandbox cleanup crashing after server restart ([#21733](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21733))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

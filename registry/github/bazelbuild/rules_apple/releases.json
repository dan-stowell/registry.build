initial support for Apple `.doccarchive` through a new `docc_archive` rule, thanks @luispadron! See [the docs](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/589671489e8fcbdec2803150a121d7f3f98b26e8/doc/rules-docc.md#docc_archive) for an example\r\n- Add initial *beta* visionOS support. There may be breaking changes as Xcode changes before the initial release\r\n- Fix issue where iOS CPUs defaulted to x86_64 instead of the current host arch\r\n- Fix case where xcodebuild was always being used for logic tests, thanks @erikkerber!\r\n- Fix some cases for upcoming `--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution` flip, thanks @comius!\r\n- Fix `ios_xctestrun_runner` failing when using parallel testing with a false positive saying no tests ran, thanks @kapoorlakshya!\r\n- Ignore more variants of noisy codesigning output\r\n- Assume target environment is device to ease transition to required platforms that aren't defaulting to using the `device` constraint\r\n- Silence output from appintentsmetadataprocessor\r\n\r\n## Potentially breaking changes\r\n\r\n- A `platform_mappings` file is now required in some cases (e.g. if you are on a Bazel version older than [7.0.0-pre.20230823.4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/7.0.0-pre.20230823.4)). If you do not already have one you can copy [rules_apple's](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/master/platform_mappings)\r\n- Test targets now require `minimum_os_version` (#2124)\r\n- Adds target name to bundle output paths when `bundle_name` differs from `name`. This allows having targets with the same `bundle_name` in the same `BUILD` file, thanks @chiragramani!\r\n- Replaced `apple_common.multi_arch_split` with new transition, this should not be a breaking change but is required for bazel 7.x support. Please file any issues you find!\r\n- Removes any support for Xcode prior to 14 from the rules, matching the supported versions from the App Store\r\n- Imported versioned (macOS) frameworks need to be the correct format (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/placing_content_in_a_bundle), and currently don't support `--@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple/build_settings:use_tree_artifacts_outputs`/`--define=apple.experimental.tree_artifact_outputs=1`\r\n\r\n## Notable additions\r\n\r\n- Add support for app intents through the `app_intents` attribute\r\n- Add ExtensionKit support to `ios_extension`, `macos_extension`, and `tvos_extension` rules\r\n- Add rpaths to `apple_xcframework` generated binaries\r\n- Add support for watchOS single target applications, thanks @BalestraPatrick!\r\n- Adding Support for UI Test Coverage, thanks @gabijarciskeviciute and @mattrobmattrob!\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements\r\n\r\n- Include `private_deps` when gathering resources for Apple rules\r\n- Include Apple Symbols for watchOS extensions, thanks @BalestraPatrick!\r\n- Document Xcode version selection and invalidation strategy, thanks @BalestraPatrick!\r\n- Improve exception message catching when running tests, thanks @sebastianv1!\r\n- Embed frameworks in `ios_message_extension`, thanks @brentleyjones!\r\n\r\n## Migrations\r\n\r\n- `--@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple/build_settings:use_tree_artifacts_outputs` should be used instead of `--define=apple.experimental.tree_artifact_outputs=1`. Support for the define will be removed in the future.\r\n- `--@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple/build_settings:signing_certificate_name` should be used instead of `--ios_signing_cert_name`\r\n\r\nThis release is compatible with 6.x LTS and bazel 7.x rolling releases\r\n\r\n### MODULE.bazel Snippet\r\n\r\n```bzl\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_apple\", version = \"3.0.0\", repo_name =

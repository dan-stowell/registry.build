Many of those changes are included in this list.\r\n\r\n### Alpha 2 Revisions\r\n  * JavaBuilder compilation prerelease available for testing using: `--define=experimental_use_abi_jars=1`\r\n  * jdeps automatically generated from `kt_jvm_library` rules.\r\n  * Support for `kt_kotlinc_options` to `kt_jvm_library`. Library options supersede toolchain options.\r\n  * Added `kt_kotlinc_options`:\r\n\r\n| Name  | Description | Type | Mandatory | Default |\r\n| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |\r\n|<a id=\"kt_kotlinc_options-include_stdlibs\"></a>include_stdlibs |  Don't automatically include the Kotlin standard libraries into the classpath (stdlib and reflect).   | String | optional | \"all\" |\r\n|<a id=\"kt_kotlinc_options-warn\"></a>warn |  Control warning behaviour.   | String | optional | \"report\" |\r\n|<a id=\"kt_kotlinc_options-x_allow_jvm_ir_dependencies\"></a>x_allow_jvm_ir_dependencies |  Suppress errors thrown when using dependencies not compiled by the IR backend.   | Boolean | optional | False |\r\n|<a id=\"kt_kotlinc_options-x_allow_result_return_type\"></a>x_allow_result_return_type |  Enable kotlin.Result as a return type   | Boolean | optional | False |\r\n|<a id=\"kt_kotlinc_options-x_inline_classes\"></a>x_inline_classes |  Enable experimental inline classes   | Boolean | optional | False |\r\n|<a id=\"kt_kotlinc_options-x_jvm_default\"></a>x_jvm_default |  Specifies that a JVM default method should be generated for non-abstract Kotlin interface member.   | String | optional | \"off\" |\r\n|<a id=\"kt_kotlinc_options-x_no_optimized_callable_references\"></a>x_no_optimized_callable_references |  Do not use optimized callable reference superclasses. Available from 1.4.   | Boolean | optional | False |\r\n|<a id=\"kt_kotlinc_options-x_skip_prerelease_check\"></a>x_skip_prerelease_check |  Suppress errors thrown when using pre-release classes.   | Boolean | optional | False |\r\n\r\n### Notable changes:\r\n  * Releases are now precompiled, suggested production installation is via a release archive. Please see the Development Guide \r\n  * when running from a non-archive repository. (#271)\r\n  * Support for Kotlin compiler plugins via the kt_compiler_plugin (#308)\r\n  * Improved determinism for remote builds (#304)\r\n  * No longer packages non-kotlin generated sources (#263)\r\n  * Proper classpath handling for java plugins (#318)\r\n  * Support for propagating Kotlin version to Intellij (#242 )\r\n  * Fixes to release artifact production (#326, #327)\r\n  * Restructure the worker to be deterministic (cc039db, 3f4698a)\r\n  * Support to compilation using kotlin abi and java ijars. (#294, #347)\r\n  * Add support for Android data-binding when building with Kotlin (#346)\r\n  * Add 0 to allowed package name characters (#364)\r\n  * Specify what the compile_jar value should be when building the library (#341)\r\n  * Separate `--Xplugin` options to support multiple compiler plugins at a time (#366)\r\n  * Fix setting tags = [\"trace\", \"timings\"] on a rule. (#378)\r\n  * Kotlin 1.4 (#363)\r\n  * Support multiple source jars (#377)\r\n  * Bump serialization runtime to compatible version (#382)\r\n  * Add option rules for kotlinc and javac. (#383, #385)\r\n  * Expose kt_kotlinc_options and kt_javac_options (#386)\r\n  * Make kt_compiler_plugin work with android_binary (#388)\r\n  * Support the new Kotlin IR backend (#384)\r\n  * Add warning as error to the warn option. (b7f5832)\r\n  * Major rework of the compiler plugin infrastructure (#393)\r\n     - plugins now require an ID (formerly optional)\r\n     - plugins run in specific phases (kapt stubs, compile)\r\n     - compiler plugins may be exported via `exported_compiler_plugins` (similar to `exported_plugins` on java_library)\r\n     - some bash substitutions in working directory arguments in plugins (anvil example demonstrates)\r\n  * Option to tag a rule as kt_abi_plugin_incompatible (#362) …\r\n  * Fix java_plugins to work with Android rules (#407)\r\n  * Include KAPT generated source jars as Kotlin builder inputs (#410)\r\n  * Unify experimental java builder + abi jar flags (#411)\r\n  * Many more minor fixes.\r\n\r\nMore detail can be found in the Changelog\r\n\r\nUsage instructions can be found in the readme README\r\n\r\nThis release includes the contributions of various Googlers as well as @cgruber, @justhecuke, @szinn, @rockwotj, @IljaKroonen, @benjaminRomano, @factuno-db, @arturdryomov, @restingbull, @jongerrish, @BenHenning, @gertvdijk, @dotdat, @fkorotkov, @Wyverald, @Bencodes, @Kernald, @meteorcloudy, @comius."}]

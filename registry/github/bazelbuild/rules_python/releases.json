See [#1840](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1840).\r\n* (rules) Fixes Mac + `--build_python_zip` + {obj}`--bootstrap_impl=script`\r\n  ([#2030](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/2030)).\r\n* (rules) User dependencies come before runtime site-packages when using\r\n  {obj}`--bootstrap_impl=script`.\r\n  ([#2064](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/2064)).\r\n* (rules) Version-aware rules now return both `@_builtins` and `@rules_python`\r\n  providers instead of only one.\r\n  ([#2114](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/2114)).\r\n* (pypi) Fixed pypi parse_simpleapi_html function for feeds with package metadata\r\n  containing \">\" sign\r\n* (toolchains) Added missing executable permission to\r\n  `//python/runtime_env_toolchains` interpreter script so that it is runnable.\r\n  ([#2085](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/2085)).\r\n* (pip) Correctly use the `sdist` downloaded by the bazel downloader when using\r\n  `experimental_index_url` feature. Fixes\r\n  [#2091](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/2090).\r\n* (gazelle) Make `gazelle_python_manifest.update` manual to avoid unnecessary\r\n  network behavior.\r\n* (bzlmod): The conflicting toolchains during `python` extension will no longer\r\n  cause warnings by default. In order to see the warnings for diagnostic purposes\r\n  set the env var `RULES_PYTHON_REPO_DEBUG_VERBOSITY` to one of `INFO`, `DEBUG` or `TRACE`.\r\n  Fixes [#1818](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1818).\r\n* (runfiles) Make runfiles lookups work for the situation of Bazel 7,\r\n  Python 3.9 (or earlier, where safepath isn't present), and the Rlocation call\r\n  in the same directory as the main file.\r\n  Fixes [#1631](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1631).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n* (pypi) `compile_pip_requirements` supports multiple requirements input files as `srcs`.\r\n* (rules) `PYTHONSAFEPATH` is inherited from the calling environment to allow\r\n  disabling it (Requires {obj}`--bootstrap_impl=script`)\r\n  ([#2060](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/2060)).\r\n* (gazelle) Added `python_generation_mode_per_package_require_test_entry_point`\r\n  in order to better accommodate users who use a custom macro,\r\n  [`pytest-bazel`][pytest_bazel], [rules_python_pytest] or `rules_py`\r\n  [py_test_main] in order to integrate with `pytest`. Currently the default\r\n  flag value is set to `true` for backwards compatible behaviour, but in the\r\n  future the flag will be flipped be `false` by default.\r\n* (toolchains) New Python versions available: `3.12.4` using the [20240726] release.\r\n* (pypi) Support env markers in requirements files. Note, that this means that\r\n  if your requirements files contain env markers, the Python interpreter will\r\n  need to be run during bzlmod phase to evaluate them. This may incur\r\n  downloading an interpreter (for hermetic-based builds) or cause non-hermetic\r\n  behavior (if using a system Python).\r\n\r\n[rules_python_pytest]:

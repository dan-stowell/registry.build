What's Changed\r\n\r\n- Move Apple CC toolchain from bazel into apple_support. This is a major change that will be required to switch to when moving to bazel 7.0. This toolchain is required for targeting any non-macOS Apple platform and has many Apple specific improvements if you're only building for macOS. You can migrate to this now and get some benefits over the builtin toolchain immediately, see [the readme](https://github.com/bazelbuild/apple_support/) for setup instructions\r\n- Add `__BAZEL_EXECUTION_ROOT__` replacement in the toolchain. This allows you to pass hermetic flags that reference the execution root in the case of flags like `-fdebug-prefix-map` that require absolute paths\r\n- Remove O1 from sanitizer feature flag defaults\r\n- Add `coverage_prefix_map` feature passing `-fcoverage-prefix-map` to ObjC/C* compiles by default. This eliminates absolute paths in binaries built for coverage\r\n- Improve bzlmod support, thanks @BalestraPatrick!\r\n\r\nThis release is compatible with 5.x LTS and bazel 6.x rolling

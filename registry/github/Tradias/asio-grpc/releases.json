An unstoppable token is now used instead. Note that `asio::execution` is deprecated and should no longer be used.\r\n* Asio and `execution` may now be used within the same application. Simply link with `asio-grpc::asio-grpc(-standalone-asio)` and `asio-grpc::asio-grpc-(unifex|stdexec)`.\r\n* Add `execution::get_scheduler` support to I/O objects.\r\n* Mark senders `[[nodiscard]]`.\r\n* Fix and improve `asio-grpc.natvis`. Also add support for `stdexec`. To learn how natvis files can improve your debugging experience check out the [Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/create-custom-views-of-native-objects) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/launch-json-reference#_visualizerfile) documentation.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\n* Partially fix `agrpc::Waiter.initiate` for sender/receiver.
